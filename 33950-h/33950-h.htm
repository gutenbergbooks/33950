<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following pages have been written by my request
with a view to making the Soldiers of The Salvation Army
somewhat familiar with the life-story of one of the most
remarkable men this world has ever seen.</p>

<p>While many and varied will be the opinions respecting
the methods employed by Francis of Assisi, and while
some will doubtless strongly dissent from these methods,
yet I think no serious follower of Jesus Christ can do
otherwise than admire the sincerity, devotion and sacrifice
of the man; and further, there can be, I think, no two
opinions as to his having taught and manifested to the
world what it means to be possessed entirely by the
Saviour's spirit.</p>

<p>And what did that spirit produce? Surely it was the
same entire devotion of our all to the service of God and
humanity which we Salvationists daily teach. The difference
between our spirit and that of the subject of this
Memoir is, I trust, very slight, although the manifestations
of it are widely diverse. We are quite as extreme in our
demands as to poverty and solitude as he was, only that
we do not value these things for their own sake as he did.
We daily induce persons to leave earthly possessions and
prospects in order to go and seek the salvation of the
poor, amongst whom their future life is to be spent; and
we require our Officers to consecrate all they have to the
service of the Kingdom of God right through their career,
and to live always in a state of readiness to be sent away
from all they have known and loved&mdash;not, indeed, to live
in any cloister or hermitage, but in the solitude amidst
the crowd which must ever be more or less the lot of the
highest leaders of men.</p>

<p>The system established by Francis was not adaptable to
family life, whereas it is our joy to show how as complete
a devotion to the good of others can be manifested by the
father or mother, who spend most of their hours in toil for
the support of those dependent upon them, as by the monks
and nuns of old, even when they walked in entire harmony
with the rules of their various orders.</p>

<p>We have demonstrated that most people by the very
fact of their being engaged in business, and having to
fulfil the duties of family life, acquire extra power to
capture for God those who are still in the ranks of
worldliness and selfishness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must always expect God to require from
time to time witnesses who might step out of the ordinary
path altogether in order to revolutionise the world for Him.
It were better far to aspire to so high and holy a calling
than to excuse in ourselves any less self-denial, any easier
life than this man's boundless love to Christ constrained
him to adopt.</p>

<p>It is most melancholy to reflect that Francis died almost
broken-hearted over what he felt to be the unfaithfulness of
his brethren. We believe that God has guided us to plans
which, being consistent with the possibilities of modern
human life, are capable of being carried out fully and
always. But the vital question is the maintenance of that
intense spirit of personal devotion to the good Shepherd
and His lost sheep, which can alone render any such
scheme of life possible. To that great end may this book
minister, and God grant us grace and wisdom to raise up
generation after generation of soldiers, who will not only
drink in, but fully carry out that spirit.</p>

<p>You will not be likely to find Assisi marked on any
ordinary map of Italy. It is far too unimportant a place
for that. That is to say, geographically unimportant.
Assisi lies half-way up the Appenines. The houses,
which are built of a curious kind of rosy-tinted stone,
press so closely together one above the other on the rocks, so
that each house seems trying to look over its neighbours'
head. The result of this is that from every window you
have one of the grandest views in Europe. Above, the
mountains tower into the sky, and yet they are not so
close as to suggest crowding. Beneath lies stretched out
the Umbrian plain, the centre and heart of Italy. With
its rich harvests, plentiful streams and luxuriant vegetation,
it might well be called the Eden of Italy.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is clear and transparent, and the nights,
with their dark blue cloudless skies, studded with myriads
of shining, sparkling stars, are better imagined than
described!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Like a Prince.</i></div>

<p>It was midway up one of the narrow steep little streets,
in one of those rosy-tinted houses, that Francis Bernardone
was born, about six hundred years ago. Only he wasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Francis just then. He was John. As a matter of fact
there was no such name as Francis known in Assisi, and
some think it was invented there and then for the first
time by Pietro Bernardone.</p>

<p>When his baby was born, Pietro was far away, travelling
in France. He was a merchant, and his business often
took him away from home. As there were no letters or
telegrams to tell him the news, it was not till he got back
that he found he had a baby son, who had been duly
christened John at the parish church. But Pietro had no
idea of letting a little matter of this kind stand in his way,
and he told his wife, Pica, that the baby was not to be
John, but Francis or Francesca. And Francis he was.</p>

<p>The neighbours didn't like it at all. Why should
Pietro set himself up to be so much better than other folks
that he must needs invent a name for his baby? In what
was his baby better than any of theirs? And so forth.
Oh, Assisi was a very natural little town! From his babyhood
these neighbours sat in judgment on little Francis.
There was nothing much about him that pleased them.
They disapproved of his dress, which was rich and fine, and
always according to the latest fashion; of his idle, free,
careless ways, of his handsome face, of his superabundance
of pocket-money.</p>

<p>"Your son lives like a prince," a neighbour said once
to Pica.</p>

<p>"What is that to you!" retorted Pica, "our son does
indeed live like a prince. Have patience, the day may
come when he will live like the Son of God."</p>

<p>But in truth that day seemed long in coming, and the
neighbours might well be forgiven when they said among
themselves that young Francis Bernardone was being
utterly spoiled. It was quite true. Frank, gay, good-tempered,
easily led, fond of all kinds of beauty and soft
living, the life of indulgence and ease and pleasure that
he was brought up in was not the one that would best fit
him for the battle of life. Pietro was rich, and he was also
exceeding proud of his handsome gay son. It delighted
him more than anything else to hear people say that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
looked like a prince of royal blood, and he denied him
nothing that money could procure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Young Manhood.</i></div>

<p>As he grew up into young manhood, Francis nominally
assisted his father in his business as cloth merchant. His
duties, however, were very light, and he was known more
as a leader among the gay youth of Assisi than as a rising
business man. He was always chosen as the leader of
the sumptuous feasts that the young men of that era wiled
away the evening hours with. After the feast was over,
Francis used to lead his band out into the streets, and
there under those glorious starry skies they finished the
night singing the then popular love songs of France and
Italy. As Francis was intensely musical, and possessed a
very fine voice, he was indispensable at these revelries.</p>

<p>He was almost twenty-five before he had his first serious
thought. Up to then life had been an enchanted dream.
Francis, with his handsome face, beautiful courteous manners,
and full pockets the centre of it. He had seen life outside
Assisi, for he had fought for his country and suffered
imprisonment. He had travelled a little, was fairly well
educated, and what was rare in those days spoke and sang
in the French language. Of God he seems to have had no
knowledge whatever. His kindly, polite nature led him to
much almsgiving, but that was merely the outcome of a
disposition which hated to see suffering.</p>

<p>Francis' lack of religion is not much to be wondered
at when we look at the state of the church in his time.
Christianity had become old, its first freshness had worn
off, and its primitive teaching had fallen into decay. A
Christian's life was an easy one, and the service rendered
was more of church-going and almsgiving, than purity of
heart and life. In many instances those who filled the
office of teacher and preacher were corrupt, and lived only
for themselves, and the whole tendency of the times was to
the most extreme laxity.</p>

<p>When almost twenty-five years old, Francis had a very severe
illness. For weeks he lay at death's door, and for weeks
after all danger was passed, he was confined to the house
too weak to move. As his weary convalescence dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
itself along, one absorbing desire filled his mind. If only
he could get out of doors, and stand once again in the sunshine,
and feast his eyes on the landscape below him!
Francis, like all Italians, was a passionate lover of his
native country, and at last, one day, he wearily and painfully
crawled out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Things that Perish.</i></div>

<p>But what was the matter? The sunshine was there.
It flooded the country. The breeze that was to bring him
new life and vigor played among his chestnut curls. The
mountains towered in their noble grandeur. The wide
Umbrian plain lay stretched out at his feet. The skies
were as blue, and the flowers as gay and sweet, as ever his
fancy painted them. But the young man turned away
with a sickening sense of disappointment and failure.</p>

<p>"Things that perish," he said mournfully to himself,
and thought bitterly of his past life with its gaiety and
frivolity. It, too, was among the "things that perish."
Life was a dreary emptiness.</p>

<p>It was the old, old story. "Thou hast made us for
Thyself, oh God, and the heart is restless till it finds its
rest in Thee." That tide which flows at least once in the
life of every human being was surging round Francis.
Happy they who, leaving all else, cast themselves into the
infinite ocean of the Divine will and design.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Change.</span></h3>

<div class="poem0"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In this easy, painless life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from struggle, care, and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever on my doubting breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies the shadow of unrest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This no path that Jesus trod&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can the smooth way lead to God?"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>As health returned, Francis determined that he would
no longer waste his life. He had spent a quarter of a
century in ease, and pleasure, and amusement. Now,
some way or other, there should be a change. Religion to
Francis meant acting up to all the duties of his church.
This he had already done, and not for a moment did he
dream that there was in what he called "religion" any
balm for a sore and wounded spirit. It never occurred to him
to seek in prayer the mind of the Lord concerning his
future. Oh, no, it was many a long day before Francis
knew the real meaning of the word prayer. He was convinced
of his wrong, and determined to right it. That was
as far as he had got. What to do was now the great
question.</p>

<p>Just about this time, a nobleman of Assisi, Walter of
Brienne, was about to start for Apulia, to take part in a
war which was going on there. All at once it occurred to
Francis that he would go too. He was naturally
courageous, and visions filled his mind of the deeds he
would do, and the honours that would be bestowed upon
him.</p>

<p>He hastened at once to the nobleman and begged to be
allowed to accompany him. Permission was granted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Francis set about getting his outfit ready. His rich
costume was far more splendid than that of Walter himself,
and the trappings of his horse and his general
accoutrements were all in keeping, so that altogether
Francis was a very magnificent personage indeed!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Voice.</i></div>

<p>A few nights before he started, he dreamed a strange
dream. He was sleeping, and he thought somebody called
him out of his sleep.</p>

<p>"Francis, Francis," said a voice.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to Francis that he awoke and found himself
in a vast armoury. All around him hung shields and
spears and swords, and weapons of all kinds. But the
most curious part of it was that each weapon was marked
with a cross. In his heart he wondered what it could all
mean, and as he was wondering, the voice answered his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"These are for thee and for thy followers," it said, and
then Francis awoke.</p>

<p>It was an age when dreams were counted of much importance,
and Francis rejoiced over this of his. Heaven,
he said to himself, had smiled upon his enterprise. God
had undertaken to lead him by the hand, and to what
heights could he not aspire! Dreams of earthly honor and
distinction floated through his brain as he dressed, and
when he went downstairs everybody asked what made him
look so radiant.</p>

<p>"I have the certainty of becoming a great prince," he
answered.</p>

<p>Yes, truly, he was to be a prince among men! Could
he have seen then the rough road that God was preparing
for him, would he have drawn back? Happily for us, we
live a day at a time, and further than that our eyes are
holden.</p>

<p>With a great deal of pomp and display, at the appointed
time Francis mounted his horse and set off. But his
journey was a short one. About thirty miles from Assisi
he was taken ill with an attack of his life-long enemy&mdash;the
fever&mdash;and forced to lie by. He chafed a good deal at
this, and wondered and pondered over the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
actions of a Providence which had so manifestly sanctioned
his expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Master or the Servant?</i></div>

<p>One evening he was lying half unconscious when he
thought he heard the same voice that spoke to him before
he started.</p>

<p>"Francis," it asked, "what could benefit thee most, the
Master or the servant, the rich man or the poor?"</p>

<p>"The Master and the rich man," answered Francis in
wonderment.</p>

<p>"Why, then," went on the voice, "dost thou leave God,
Who is the Master and rich, for man, who is the servant
and poor?"</p>

<p>"Then, Lord, what wilt Thou that I do?" queried
Francis.</p>

<p>"Return to thy native town, and it shall be shown thee
there what thou shalt do," said the voice.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of all Francis' after life that he
never stopped to query what looked like contradiction of
orders, but as soon as ever he was well enough he
travelled back home again. His ambition for future
greatness, and earthly distinction and honor, all seemed to
be lost sight of when the Divine voice spoke. For Francis
was convinced that God had spoken to him.</p>

<p>It was certainly not easy for a nature like his to
return home whence a few short days before, he had
departed with such pomp and glory. His father was not
over rejoiced to welcome him back, but his friends, who
worshipped him, "the flower of Assisi," as they called him,
received him gladly. Things had been dull without
Francis. His merry songs and jests were missed at the
evening feast. For a time he took up the life he had
quitted. There was nothing else to do as far as he could
see. But he was changed. Even his companions were
forced to own that. He sang, and laughed, and jested as
usual, but the heart had gone out of his song and laughter,
and he was prone to fall into deep fits of meditation.</p>

<p>It was a far from satisfactory life. He cared no longer
for what was once his very existence, and he knew not
as yet to what God would have him turn. He desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
serve God, and gave himself to almsgiving. He made a
pilgrimage to Rome, only to be disgusted with the miserable
offerings put into the treasury by the pilgrims.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Conflicts.</i></div>

<p>"Is this all they spare to God?" he cried, and pulling
out his purse flung its contents among the rest.</p>

<p>He was tormented and haunted by recollections of his
past mis-spent life, and for days he mourned over what
was beyond recall.</p>

<p>There was a certain old woman in Assisi, horribly
deformed and hideously ugly. Francis, with his innate
love of the beautiful, recoiled in horror every time he met
her. She was a nightmare to him, and he would go far
to avoid seeing her. The devil, who is ever ready to work
on the weakness of a human soul, used this old woman to
torture him.</p>

<p>"See," he said, "a picture of what you will become if
you persist in mortifying yourself, and leading a life
devoted to God. You will become as ugly and repulsive
as that old woman in time."</p>

<p>The bare idea was agonizing to Francis. The old
woman turned up continually, and seemed to pursue him
like a phantom. The temptation may seem to stronger
souls an ignoble one, but it was an intense and severe one
to Francis. He conquered by yielding himself up to the
will of God. He accepted everything&mdash;deformity, ugliness,
pain&mdash;if it were God's plan for him. Then and only then
had he rest.</p>

<p>As soon as he had given up his warlike ambitions and
returned to Assisi, he had been in the habit of going off by
himself into a cave or grotto, and there being alone with
his thoughts. Many a conflict did that cave see, as
Francis with tears and cries entreated the Lord to show
him how best to employ his life. It was during one of
these seasons that his spiritual eyes were opened.
Hitherto he had followed blindly an almost unknown God,
but he <i>had</i> followed and sought, and the end of his faith
was sight.</p>

<p>It came upon him all at once. Christ&mdash;His love for the
sinner, His love for him&mdash;Christ, bleeding, dying, suffering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for very love&mdash;Christ the pure, long-suffering, merciful,
patient&mdash;Christ the Son of God made Man for us. A wave
of great joy swept over Francis, and he wept for very gladness
of heart. Here was his Master, his Lord. He had
found Him, and henceforth following was easy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Lepers.</i></div>

<p>Not one of the many translations of the life of Francis,
omits to mention his self-imposed mission to the lepers.
Assisi, like most foreign towns of the age, was infested
with lepers. They were not allowed to live in the towns,
but had houses (lazaretti) built for them quite outside.
Francis had a deep-rooted repugnance to a leper, and, in
passing a lazaretto, always carefully covered up his nose lest
any bad odour might reach him, and he always rode far away
in the opposite direction, if he chanced to see one in the
plains. Nothing shows the change in Francis more than
his alteration towards the lepers. One day, when out
riding, he saw a leper approaching. His first instinct was
his natural one to get away at once. His second, that God
required something more of him. Who was he, to loathe
and avoid a fellow-creature. Riding up to the leper, he
dismounted, gave him some money, and then without a
shudder, kissed the dreadful hand held out to him. He
had done the impossible, and from this time he constantly
visited the lazaretti, putting himself in personal contact
with the lepers, giving them money, and doing all he could
to lessen their sufferings.</p>

<p>Of this period of his experience he writes long years
after:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I was in sin it was very bitter to me to behold
lepers, but the Lord Himself having led me amongst them,
I exercised mercy towards them, and when I left them I
felt that what had seemed so bitter to me was changed
into sweetness for my soul and body."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Lonely Struggle.</span></h3>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou must walk on, however man upbraid thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With Him who trod the winepress all alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou may'st not find one human hand to aid thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One human soul to comprehend thy own."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>A rough, stony uphill path, or rather track, under
grey-green olive trees, leading to a perfect tangle of
cypresses and pines. Somewhere in the tangle of cypresses
almost hidden from sight, lay a dilapidated ancient church,
which, long ago had been dedicated to the martyr Damian.
Up this stony track one day, stumbled Francis.</p>

<p>His was now a solitary life. He was a complete puzzle
to parents and friends, and, indeed to a great extent he
was a puzzle to himself. His life in his father's house
was far from pleasant. Pietro's vanity had received a
serious blow from what he regarded as his son's "ignominious"
return to Assisi. He had been more than
willing to give him ample means for every pleasure, so
that he might mingle on an equal footing with the young
nobles of the land, but to see his money given lavishly to
the beggars in the street, and the lepers in the lazar-houses
was more than he could stand. A serious, ever
widening breach had formed between father and son.
Pica, poor woman, knew that, sooner or later, a rupture
would come, and much as she loved her strange son, she
could do nothing to prevent it. There was literally no
one who could comprehend Francis, much less render him
any spiritual aid. One faithful companion there had
been, who used to follow him round into the woods when
he went to pray, and stand at the doors of caves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
grottos until his season of meditation was over, but after a
time, this friend had been obliged to leave him. Francis
tried timidly to tell people a little of what God was dimly
revealing to him, but his&mdash;to them&mdash;vague ideas only
resulted in mocking smiles, and assurances that he was
rapidly becoming stark, staring mad! So had things
come about, that in spite of himself, Francis was thrown
entirely and solely upon his new found Lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Prayer and its Answer.</i></div>

<p>The cross lay heavy upon him that day, as he stumbled
up the tiny olive-shaded path, and lit upon the almost
ruined church. This was a direction Francis seldom
walked in, but to-day he had been so occupied with his
thoughts, that he scarcely knew where he was going.
Seeing the church, he passed in and knelt to pray.</p>

<p>"Great and glorious God," was his prayer; "and Thou,
Lord Jesus, I pray Thee, shed abroad Thy light in the
darkness of my mind. Be found of me, Lord, so that in
all things I may act only in accordance with Thy holy
will."</p>

<p>As he prayed, little by little a sense of peace, and a new
feeling of acceptance took possession of him. He had
known before that God had pardoned him for the past,
and was keeping him in the midst of trials and hourly
temptations, but this was something quite different. Jesus
accepted him, individually, his body as well as his soul, his
time, talents, all his being, and desired his labour and
assistance. The poor, lonely, crushed heart, was filled to
overflowing. He was conscious of a distinct union with
Christ. From this time forth, he was to know what it
meant to be crucified with Christ&mdash;to die daily.</p>

<p>As he knelt there among the ruins and decay, it seemed
to him that a voice spoke to his soul thus&mdash;</p>

<p>"Francis, dost thou see how my house is falling into
ruins? Go and set thyself to repair it."</p>

<p>"Most willingly, Lord," he answered, hardly knowing
what he said.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>For the Benefit of St. Damian's.</i></div>

<p>Now, respecting the incidents we are about to relate,
there are many and various theories. Some say the
revelation made to Francis, referred to the spiritual work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to which he had not as yet received his call, others there
are, who blame him and call him rash and hot-headed,
and accuse him of running before he was sent. We are
not prepared to give judgment one way or the other. God
has not promised us that we shall never make mistakes,
and if Francis made a mistake, God certainly over-ruled
it, and made it work to His glory, as He has promised
"all things" to work for those who love Him. Again,
God has His own ways of working, mysterious and curious
though they often seem to us, and what looks like "the
foolishness of men," often redounds to His greatest praise.
But to return to what really happened.</p>

<p>Francis rose from his knees, and sought the priest who
had charge of St. Damian's. He pressed all the money he
had about him into his hands, begged him to buy oil and
keep the lamp always burning, then rushed off home.
Saddling his horse, he loaded it with the most costly
stuffs he could find, and rode off into a neighbouring town,
where they found a ready market, and realized a goodly
sum. When his stuff was all sold, he disposed of his
horse too, and returning on foot to St. Damian's, he
placed a well-filled purse in the priest's hands, told him
with much satisfaction what he had done, and begged him
to have the church restored at once. To his utter consternation,
the priest refused, saying he dare not take so
large a sum unless Pietro Bernardone approved.</p>

<p>Poor Francis was in despair. He flung the money on a
window seat in disgust, and begged the priest at least to
give him a shelter for a few days. That much bewildered
man, hardly knowing what to say or do, consented, and
Francis took up his abode with him.</p>

<p>But not for long. Pietro, when he found his son
did not return home as usual, made enquiries and found
where he was located. He was very anxious and uneasy,
as he was sure now that his son was afflicted by a religious
mania, he would have to renounce all the high hopes
he had formed for him. However, he resolved to make a
determined effort to recover him, and set out with a large
party of friends to storm St. Damian's. They hoped that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Francis would listen to reason, and consent to follow them
back quietly to Assisi.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Lonely Struggle.</i></div>

<p>But Francis never waited to receive them. An uncontrollable
fear took possession of him, and he fled and hid
himself in a cavern he alone knew of. His father's party
ransacked the priest's abode, and all the country round,
but they had to return home baffled.</p>

<p>For a month, Francis remained shut up in the cavern.
An old servant who loved him dearly, was let into the
secret, and used to bring him food. During this month
he suffered intensely. It was the first time in his life he
had ever suffered contradiction&mdash;the first time in his life
he had ever had anyone really, openly opposed to him.
To be sure, people did not understand him, but they had
never shown him any animosity. A sense of utter failure
oppressed him. It was a hard trial to one of his temperament,
and if his consecration had not been very real, he
would never have stood the test.</p>

<p>He wept and prayed, and confessed his utter nothingness,
his weakness, his inability to accomplish anything of
himself. Never in his life had he felt weak and incapable
before. Then humbly he entreated that God would
enable him to accomplish His will, and not permit his
incapacity to frustrate God's designs for him. A consciousness
of Divine strength was manifested to him as
never before. It was as if a voice said, "I will be with
thee, fear not." Strengthened with a strength he never
knew heretofore, he came out of the cavern and made
straight for his father's house.</p>

<p>That day as Pietro Bernardone sat at work indoors, the
voice of a mighty tumult was borne in to him. Such a
clamour, and yelling, and shouting he never had heard
in Assisi in all his time! Rushing upstairs he looked out
of the window. It seemed as though the entire populace
had turned loose, and were buffeting someone in their
midst.</p>

<p>"A madman, a madman," yelled the crowd, and sticks
and stones and mud flew from all sides.</p>

<p>"A madman, a madman," echoed the children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Determined not to lose the fun, Pietro hastened out into
the street, joined the crowd, and discovered that his son
Francis was the madman in question! With a howl of
rage, he rushed upon him, dragged him into the house
with oaths and blows, and locked him up in a sort of
dungeon.</p>

<p>During the succeeding days, he and his wife did all they
could to persuade Francis to return to his old mode of life.
Pietro entreated and threatened, Pica wept and caressed,
but all in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Command from God.</i></div>

<p>"I have received a command from God," was their
answer, and "I mean to carry it out."</p>

<p>At last, after some time, Pietro being absent for several
days on business, Pica unlocked the dungeon and let her
son go free.</p>

<p>When Pietro returned, he cursed his wife and set off to
St. Damian's to fetch Francis back. But Francis declined
to go. He said that he feared neither blows nor chains,
but God had given him a work to do, and nothing, nor
nobody would prevent him carrying out that mission.
Pietro was struck by his son's coolness, and seeing that
force would be no use, he went to the magistrates and
lodged a complaint against his son, desiring the magistrates
to recover the money that his son had given to the
church, and to oblige him to renounce in legal form all rights
of inheritance. The magistrates seem to have been much
shocked at Pietro's harshness, but they summoned Francis,
who would not appear. When asked to use violence, they
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, since your son has entered God's service, we have
nothing to do with his actions," and utterly refused to
have anything further to do with the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Victory Without and Within.</span></h3>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For poverty and self-renunciation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Father yieldeth back a thousand-fold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the calm stillness of regeneration,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cometh a joy we never knew of old."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Pietro was not avaricious. He cared nothing for the
money as money. His plan now was to cut off all supplies,
and when his son, who had always been accustomed to the
daintiest and softest of living, and was in no way inured
to hardship, found that he was now literally a beggar, he
would, after a little privation, come to his senses, and sue
his father for pardon. This was his idea when he sought
the bishop and made his complaint to him. The bishop
called Francis to appear before him.</p>

<p>On the appointed day he appeared with his father. The
venerable bishop, who was a man of great good sense and
wisdom, heard all there was to hear, and then turning to
the young man, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My son, thy father is greatly incensed against thee.
If thou desirest to consecrate thyself to God, restore to him
all that is his."</p>

<p>He went on to say that the money was not really
Francis', and therefore he had no right to give away what
was not his, besides God would never accept money that
was an occasion of sin between father and son. Then
Francis rose and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, I will give back everything to my father,
even the clothes I have had from him!"</p>

<p>Returning into a neighbouring room, he stripped off all
his rich garments, and clad only in a hair under-garment,
laid them and the purse of money at his father's feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>One Father.</i></div>

<p>"Now," he cried, "I have but one father, henceforth I
can say in all truth "Our Father who art in Heaven!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence. Everybody
present was too astonished to speak, then Pietro gathered
up the garments and money, and withdrew. A murmur
of pity swept through the crowd as they looked at the
young man standing half-naked before the tribunal. But
no sentiments of pity stirred Pietro. Easy and good-natured
when things went according to his liking, he was
equally hard and unbending if his will was crossed. It
was to him a rude awakening out of a glorious, golden
dream, and from his standpoint life looked hard.</p>

<p>When Pietro departed the old bishop threw his own
mantle round the young man's shoulders, and sent out for
some suitable garment. Nothing, however, was forthcoming
except a peasant's cloak belonging to one of the
gardeners. This Francis gladly put on and passed out of
the bishop's hall&mdash;a homeless wanderer on the face of the
earth.</p>

<p>He was not inclined to return to St. Damian's at once.
He desired solitude, so he plunged into the woods. As
he travelled he sang with all his might praises to God in
the French tongue. His singing attracted the notice of
some robbers who were hidden in the fastness of the woods.
They sprang out and seized him, demanding&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>Francis always courteous replied,</p>

<p>"I am the herald of the Great King. But what does
that concern you?"</p>

<p>The robbers laughed at him for a madman, and after
they had made game of him for a time, they tore his garment
from his back, and tossing him into a deep ditch
where a quantity of snow still lay, they made off crying,</p>

<p>"Lie there, you poor herald of the Good God!"</p>

<p>When they had disappeared Francis scrambled out stiff
with cold and clad only in his one garment, and went on
his way singing as before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Kitchen Assistant.</i></div>

<p>Happily his wanderings speedily brought him to a
monastery among the mountains. He knocked at the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and begged for help. The monks regarded this strange
half-naked applicant with much suspicion, and one can
hardly blame them. Nevertheless they received him, and
gave him employment in their kitchen as assistant to the
cook, to do the rough and heavy work. His food was of
the commonest and coarsest, and it never seemed to occur
to any of them that he would be the better for a few more
clothes. When his solitary garment appeared in imminent
danger of dropping to pieces he left the monastery and
went on a little further to a neighbouring town where a
friend of his lived. He made his way to this friend and
asked him out of charity to provide him with a worn garment
to cover his nakedness. The case was manifestly an
urgent one, and the friend bestowed upon him a suit of
clothes consisting of a tunic, leather belt, shoes, and a
stick. It was very much the kind of costume then worn
by the hermits.</p>

<p>From here he started back again to St. Damian's. He
stopped on his way to visit a lazar-house, and help in the
care of the lepers. He had quite gotten over all his early
antipathies, and it was a joy to him now to minister to
those poor diseased ones. Probably he would have spent
a much longer season here if it were not that again he
seemed to hear the same voice calling him to repair the
ruined church. So he left the lazar-house and proceeded
on his way. He told his friend the priest that he was in
no way disappointed or cast down, and that he had good
reason to believe that he would be able to accomplish his
purpose.</p>

<p>There was only one way in which he could attain this
end. Money he had none, neither did he know of anyone
who loved God and His cause well enough to expend a
little of their riches in rebuilding His house. Next day
saw him at work. Up and down the streets of his native
town he went begging for stones to rebuild St. Damian.</p>

<p>"He who gives me one stone shall receive one blessing,
he who gives me two will have two blessings, and he who
gives me three, three blessings."</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<i>He is quite Mad.</i>"</div>

<p>The people were unable to do anything at first from pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
astonishment. Francis Bernardone, the gay cavalier, the
leader of feasts and song, sueing in the streets like a common
beggar! They could hardly believe their eyes!
"Truly the fellow was mad," they said to each other! But
he did not look mad. His smile was as sweet as ever, and
the native, polished, courtly manners that had won for him
so many friends, now that they were sanctified, were doubly
winning. It was impossible to resist him, and stones were
brought him in quantities. Load after load, interminable
loads he bore on his back like a labourer to St. Damian.
Up the steep little path he toiled between the grey green
olives, on and into the tangle of cypress and pine, and
there stone by stone with his own hands he repaired the
crumbling walls. It was a long wearisome toilsome work,
and told considerably on his health.</p>

<p>"He is <i>quite</i> mad," reiterated some as the days passed
from spring to summer, and from summer to autumn and
from autumn into winter again. But there were others
who watched him with tears in their eyes. <i>They</i>
knew he was not mad. They realized that a great power
had changed the once refined man into a servant of all&mdash;even
the constraining power of the love of Christ, and they
shed tears when they thought how far they came
short.</p>

<p>The priest of St. Damian's was deeply touched at
Francis' self-sacrificing work, and often grieved when he
saw him doing what he was physically so unfitted for. He
conceived a violent admiration for his young lodger, and in
spite of his poverty he always contrived to have some dainty
dish, or tit-bit for him when he returned to meals. Now
Francis always had been particular as to his food, he liked
it well served, and he was also very fond of all kinds of
sweets and confectionery. For a time he thanked his
friend and ate gratefully the pleasant dishes he had provided.
One day as he sat at dinner the thought came to
him "what should I do if I had nobody to provide my
meals." Then he saw for the first time that he was still
under bondage to his appetite. He enjoyed nice food, it
seemed necessary to him&mdash;but was it like that Life he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
so earnestly strove to copy. Francis sat condemned. The
next moment he jumped up and seizing a wooden bowl he
went round the streets from door to door begging for scraps
of broken meat and bread. The people stared harder than
ever, but in a little time his bowl was quite full, and he
returned home and sat down to eat his rations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Beggar.</i></div>

<p>He tried hard, but he turned against them with loathing.
In all his life he thought he had never seen such a horrid
collection! Then, lifting his heart to God, he made another
trial and tasted the food. Lo and behold it was not bad,
and as he continued his coarse meal he thought that no
dish had ever tasted better! Praising God for victory he
went to the priest and told him that he would be no
further expense to him, from henceforth he would beg his
meals.</p>

<p>When Pietro heard that his son had added to his
eccentricities by begging for his food his anger knew no
bounds! When he met him in the streets he blushed with
shame, and often cursed him. But if his family were
ashamed of him, there were many among the townsfolk
with whom he found sympathy. Help came in on all
sides, and at last the walls were repaired, and the church
was no longer in danger of tumbling into a mass of ruins.
What was needed for the inside was got in the same way
as the stones, and pretty soon a congregation was forthcoming.</p>

<p>One of the hardest sacrifices God required from Francis
connected with this work was one evening when he was
out begging from house to house for oil to light the church.
He came to a house where an entertainment was going on,
a feast very similar to those he had so often presided over
in his worldly days. He looked down on his poor common
dress, and thought with shame what a figure he would cut
among the gay, well-dressed crowd within. For a moment
he felt tempted to skip this house. But it was only for a
moment; reproaching himself bitterly, he pushed in and
standing before the festive gathering, told them simply
how much he had objected to coming in, and for what
reason, adding that he feared his timidity was counted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
him as sin, because he was working in God's name, and in
His service. His request was taken in good part, and
his words so touched all present that they were eager to
give him the aid he sought.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>St. Damian's Finished.</i></div>

<p>After St. Damian's was quite restored, Francis set to
work and did the same for two other equally needy churches
in the vicinity. One was St. Peter's, and the other St.
Mary's or the Portiuncula. The second one became
eventually the cradle of the Franciscan movement. Here
he built for himself a cell, where he used to come to pour
out his soul in prayer. When his work of repairing came
to an end, he gave himself up to meditation, his whole
idea being that he would henceforth lead the life of a
recluse. But God disposed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Francis' Call.</span></h3>

<div class="poem0"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, my Lord, the Crucified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for love of me hast died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mould me by Thy living breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the likeness of Thy death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the thorns Thy brows entwine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let no flower wreath rest on mine."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>But Francis kept a listening ear. God's word was his
law, and though he to a certain extent planned what he
would do next, yet he left himself entirely free in his
Lord's hands, and at His disposal. Had he not remained
in this attitude of soul, or had he become wise in his own
conceits, or failed to keep his heart and soul fresh with
the first vital freshness of regeneration, what would have
become of the great Franciscan movement that was destined
ultimately to stir the world? God alone knows. <i>He</i> keeps
count of lost opportunities, calls neglected, soul stirrings
lulled to barren fruitless slumber!</p>

<p>The natural tendency of a soul which has been awakened
to great action, and accomplished daring feats, is&mdash;the first
strain passed&mdash;to relax, or settle down. It is only the
minority that struggle and fight and get the victory over
this subtle temptation. The same principle applies in a
larger scale, and that is why it is so many glorious religious
movements have run a course and then dwindled into
mediocrity, the later disciples carving for themselves a
medium way.</p>

<p>Francis' life-work might easily have dwindled into
nothing just here. He had not the least intimation that
the Lord demanded anything more of him but that he
should love and serve Him all the days of his life, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
ordinary unobtrusive manner. Two years had been spent
in repairing the churches, and Francis was now between
twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>His Commission.</i></div>

<p>It was on the twenty-fourth of February in the year
1209 that he received his call to direct spiritual work.
That morning he went to church as usual, and the words
of the Gospel for the day came to him direct from Jesus
Christ Himself.</p>

<p>"Wherever ye go preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast
out devils. Freely ye have received, freely give. Provide
neither silver nor gold nor brass in your purses, neither
scrip, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor staff, for the laborer
is worthy of his hire.'"</p>

<p>These words were a revelation.</p>

<p>"This is what I want," cried Francis, as he left the
church, conscious for the first time that he had wanted
something. "This is what I have long been seeking, from
this day forth I shall set myself with all my strength to
put it in practice."</p>

<p>Immediately he took up his new commission. He threw
away his shoes, his stick, his purse, and put on the coarse
dress of the peasant of the Apennines, and girded it with a
rough piece of rope, the first thing he could find. Thus
equipped, he set out a true Knight of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and for the first time in his life began to talk to
the people he met about their souls. That eloquent fiery
tongue, that was destined to make him one of the orators
of the age, had not yet become unloosed, and Francis was
simplicity itself. Indeed, he did not at first attempt to
make anything like a speech or sermon. His efforts were
directed towards people whom he was acquainted with, and
these he urged to repent in the name of the Lord. He
told his own experience, and spoke of the shortness of life,
of punishment after death, of the need of heart and life
holiness. His halting words struck home, they pierced
like a sword, and many thus convicted, repented and
turned from their evil ways.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Sanctified Leader of Men.</i></div>

<p>For over two years now, Francis had lived a solitary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and&mdash;humanly speaking&mdash;a lonely life. He had, however,
during that time proved the sufficiency of God. We do
not read that he ever longed for a human friend, one that
could understand and sympathise with him, so richly had
God supplied his every need. But the time had come when
his solitude was to end. God was about to raise him up
friends. Again he was to take up his old position as a
leader of men, only a sanctified one.</p>

<p>Bernardo di Quintavelle was a man of birth and position.
He was a few years older than Francis, and as he lived in
Assisi, he had full opportunity of watching all Francis'
vagaries, for so his actions looked to him at first. However,
as time passed, and Francis' supposed mania failed to
develop into anything very dangerous, Bernardo puzzled
and wondered. What was it, he asked himself, that had
so completely changed the gay, frivolous, ease-loving
Francis Bernardone, into a poor hard-working beggar?
Was he really as good and holy as the common people
began to whisper to themselves? We must bear in mind
that vital religion in Assisi was at its lowest ebb, and the
kind that worked itself out in daily life and action almost
unknown.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Bernardo determined to study Francis close
to. Again and again he invited him to his house, and the
more he saw of the gracious, humble, God-fearing, Francis,
the more he liked him. One night he asked him to stay
till the next day, and Francis consenting, he had a bed
made up for him in his own room. They retired. In a
short time Bernardo was, to all appearances, extremely
sound asleep. Then Francis rose from his bed, and
kneeling down began to pray. A deep sense of the Divine
presence overflowed him, and he could do nothing but
weep and cry, "Oh, my God, oh, my God!" He continued
all night praying, and weeping before the Lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bernardo.</i></div>

<p>Now Bernardo, who was only pretending to be asleep in
order to see what Francis would do, was greatly touched.
God visited him too that night, and spoke to his soul so
loudly and clearly that he dare not do ought but follow the
light that that night began to glimmer on his future path.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Little he thought into what a large place it would ultimately
lead him.</p>

<p>Next morning, true to his new-born inspiration, he said
to Francis&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am disposed in my heart to leave the world and obey
thee in all that thou shalt command me."</p>

<p>To say that Francis was surprised is to say too little!
He was astonished&mdash;so astonished that it was difficult to
find words in which to answer. That the people he
influenced would rise up and desire to share his life, with
its privations, and eccentricities had never as yet occurred
to him. His sole and only aim had been that his every
individual act and thought should be in conformity to
that of our Lord Jesus Christ. But "I, if I be lifted
up, will draw all men unto Me," and Francis, by his
humble life and work, had brought that Blessed Life
wherever he went. This is the Divine design for every
faithful soul that seeks to truly follow its Master. The
man who could live and spread holiness as an ordinary
day-laborer and stone-mason was now to receive a greater
charge. As soon as he recovered from the first surprise of
Bernardo's statement, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bernardo, a resolution such as the one thou speakest
of is so difficult, and so great an action, that we must take
counsel of the Lord Jesus, and pray Him that He may
point out His will, and teach us to follow it."</p>

<p>So they set off together for the church. While on their
way there that morning they were joined by another
brother called Pietro, who said that he too had been told
of God to join Francis. So the three went together to
read the Gospels and pray for light.</p>

<p>Francis was soon convinced that Bernardo and Pietro
were led of God, and joyfully welcomed them as his fellow-laborers.
They took up their abode in a deserted mud
hut, close by a river known as the Riva Torto. And that
mean little hut was the cradle which contained the beginning
of a work that spread itself into every quarter of
the globe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Egidio.</i></div>

<p>"Francis," said Bernardo, a little later, "What wouldst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
thou do supposing a great king had given thee possessions
for which thou afterwards hadst no use?"</p>

<p>"Why, give them back to be sure," answered Francis.</p>

<p>"Then," said Bernardo, "I will that I sell all my
possessions, and give the money to the poor."</p>

<p>So he did. Land, houses, all that he possessed he sold, and
distributed the proceeds to the poor in the market-place.
One can easily imagine the sensation this caused in Assisi,
and how almost the entire population thronged to the spot!</p>

<p>The news of this day's doings spread into all the country-side.
In a town not far from Assisi, a certain young man,
called Egidio, listened intently while his father and mother
discussed Bernardo and Francis and went into their history
past and present, and speculated on their future. Little
they thought as they talked that their cultured, refined son
was drinking in every word, and that his soul was being
strangely stirred. Before the week was out, Egidio had
received the Divine touch that fitted him to respond to the
call&mdash;"Follow Me." In the marvellously colored dawn of
an Italian morning, Egidio rose and "followed."</p>

<p>Arriving in Assisi at a crossway he was at a standstill.
Where should he look for Francis? Which of those roads
should he take? While he thus alternately debated with
himself, and prayed for guidance, who should he see
coming along out of the forest where he had been to pray,
but Francis himself! There was no mistaking that curious
bare-footed figure, with its coarse robe of the color known
to the peasants as "beast" color, girded with a knotted
rope! Egidio threw himself at Francis' feet, and besought
him to receive him for the love of God.</p>

<p>"Dear brother," said Francis, who during the past week
had learned not to be surprised when he received candidates
for his work. "Dear brother, God hath conferred a great
grace upon thee! If the Emperor were to come to Assisi
and propose to make one of its citizens his knight or secret
chamberlain, would not such an offer be joyfully accepted
as a great mark of honor and distinction? How much
more shouldst thou rejoice that God hath called thee to be
His Knight and chosen servant, to observe the perfection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
His Holy Gospel! Therefore do thou stand firm in the
vocation to which God hath called thee."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>First Apostolic Tour.</i></div>

<p>So bringing him into the hut Francis called the others
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"God has sent us a good brother, let us therefore rejoice
in the Lord and eat together in charity."</p>

<p>After they had eaten breakfast Francis took Egidio into
Assisi to get cloth to make him a "beast-colored" uniform
robe like the others. On the way Francis thought he
would like to try the young man and see what kind of a
spirit he had. So upon meeting a poor woman, who asked
them for money, Francis said to Egidio&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray you, as we have no money, give this poor woman
your cloak."</p>

<p>Immediately and joyfully Egidio pulled off his rich
mantle and handed it to the beggar, whereat Francis
rejoiced much in secret.</p>

<p>It was a united household that assembled under the
rude roof of the mud hut by the Riva Torto. Four young
men bound together in love, and resolved to serve God
absolutely in whatever way He should show them, we
shall see, ere long, how God used these human instruments
which were so unreservedly placed at His disposal. They
were very happy for a few days, and gave themselves up
almost entirely to prayer; then Francis led them into the
seclusion of the woods and explained to them how the
Divine will had manifested itself to his soul.</p>

<p>"We must," he said, "clearly understand our vocation.
It is not for our personal salvation only, but for the
salvation of a great many others that God has mercifully
called us. He wishes us to go through the world, and by
example even more than by words, exhort men to repentance,
and the keeping of the commandments." Bernardo, Pietro
and Egidio declared that they were willing for anything, and
so the four separated, two by two, for a preaching tour. Of
Bernardo and Pietro history is silent, but nothing could
have been more simple than the Apostolic wanderings of
Francis and Egidio in the Marches of Ancona. Along the
roads they went wherever the Spirit of God led them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
singing songs of God and Heaven. Their songs together
with their happy countenances and strange costume,
naturally attracted the people, and when a number would
collect to stare at them, Francis would address them, and
Egidio, with charming simplicity accentuated all he said
with&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Sermonette.</i></div>

<p>"You must believe what my brother Francis tells you,
the advice he gives you is very good." But don't for a
moment imagine that Francis was capable of giving an
address. Far from it; he was, truth to say, very little in
advance of Egidio, the burden of his cry being&mdash;</p>

<p>"Love God, fear Him, repent and you shall be forgiven;"
then when Egidio had chorused,</p>

<p>"Do as my brother Francis tells you, the advice he
gives you is very good," the two missionaries passed
singing on their way!</p>

<p>But the impression produced was far beyond their
simple words. The religious history of the times tells
us that the love of God was almost dead in men's hearts,
that the world had forgotten the meaning of the word
repentance, and was entirely given up to lust and vice and
pleasure. People asked each other what could be the object
these men had in view. Why did they go about roughly-clad,
bare-foot, and eating so little. "They are madmen"
some said. Others "Madmen could not talk so wisely."
Others again, more thoughtful, said, "They seem to care so
little for life, they are desperate, and must be either mad,
or else they are aspiring to very great perfection!"</p>

<p>When the four had been through almost all the
Province they returned to Riva Torto, where they found
three new candidates clamoring for admission. Others
followed, and when the numbers had increased to about
eight, Francis led them to a spot where four roads met,
and sent them out two and two to the four points of the
compass to preach the Gospel. Everywhere they went
they were to urge men to repentance, and point them to a
Saviour who could forgive sins. They were to accept no
food they had not either worked for, or received as alms
for the love of Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Francis' Early Disciples.</span></h3>

<div class="poem2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then forth they went....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content for evermore to follow him. In weariness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In painfulness, in perils by the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through awful vigils in the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through storms of trouble, hatred and reproach.'<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Bernardo di Quintavelle is perhaps the most important
of these first followers, inasmuch as he ultimately took
his place as Leader of the Order of Friars minor, which
was the name the Franciscans first gave themselves. We
have already told how Bernardo came to join Francis,
and take upon himself the same vows. From that day his
faith and trust in God and His call to him never wavered.
That was the secret of his tremendous strength of soul.
The strength of a man who is sure of his call and its
divinity is as the strength of ten.</p>

<p>It was Bernardo whom Francis deputed in the early
days of the work to go to Bologna, and labor there.
Bologna was the centre of the universe, as far as learning
and culture went, to the Italians of that day. As soon as
Bernardo and his followers showed themselves in the town,
the children, seeing them dressed so plainly and poorly,
laughed and scoffed, and threw dirt and stones at them.
They accepted these trials manfully, and made their
way to the market-place. The children, who followed
them here continued to pelt them with stones and dust,
and pulled them round by the hoods of their garments.
Day after day, and day after day, Bernardo and his little
handful returned, though they could never get anybody to
give them a civil hearing. Poor fellows, during those
first few days, they all but starved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Great Saint!</i></div>

<p>There was a doctor of the law, who used to pass round
by the market-place every day, and seeing Bernardo
patiently put up with such insult and contempt, wondered
much to himself. At last he arrived at a conclusion.</p>

<p>"This man must be a great saint."</p>

<p>Going up to him, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who art thou, and whence dost thou come?"</p>

<p>Bernardo put his hand into his bosom, and gave him
what was then the rules of the Order. This was in other
words the Divine commission that Francis had received
through the Gospel for that February day, "Go ye forth
and preach the gospel, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The doctor read it all through and then, turning to some
of his friends who were standing by, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Truly, here is the most perfect state of religion I have
ever heard of; this man and his companions are the
holiest men I have ever met with in this world! Guilty
indeed are those who insult him! We ought, on the
contrary, to honor him as a true friend of God!"</p>

<p>Then addressing Bernardo, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If it is thy wish to found a convent in this town, in
which thou mayst serve God, I will most willingly help
thee."</p>

<p>Bernardo thanked him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe it is our Saviour Jesus Christ who hast I
inspired thee with this good intention, I most willingly
accept the offer, to the honor of Christ."</p>

<p>Then the doctor took them home with him and entertained
them, and presented them with a convenient building,
which he furnished at his own expense.</p>

<p>In a short time, Bernardo was much sought after, on
account of the holiness, together with the brilliancy of his
sermons. The whole town was at his feet, people came
from far and near to hear him, and thousands were
converted.</p>

<p>When things were at a height, Bernardo turned up
unexpectedly one day in Assisi, and presented himself
before the astonished gaze of Francis.</p>

<p>"The convent is founded at Bologna," he said, "send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
other brothers there to keep it up, I can no longer be of
any use; indeed, I fear me that the too great honors I
receive might make me lose more than I could gain."</p>

<p>Francis, who had heard a great deal of the honor and
praise that had been lavished upon Bernardo, thanked God
that He had revealed to him the danger his soul was in,
and sent someone else to Bologna.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Elias.</i></div>

<p>In striking contrast to Bernardo was Elias. Elias was
quite as clever and brilliant a man as Bernardo, but he
never seems to have become really sanctified. His pride
was a constant stumbling-block, and was for ever appearing
in some new shape or other. Sometimes it would be in
an over-weening desire to rule, and then his rule would go
far and beyond that of Francis', in fastings, and similar
austerities. Again, we have a picture of him arraying
himself in a garment of soft cloth, which could only be
said to be "modelled" after that worn by his brethren.
Finally, he lapsed altogether, declared that his health was
too delicate to stand coarse food and plain living, and left
the Order. For some time he was an open backslider, but
it is currently supposed he was converted before he died.
The story of his life is a sad one. Looking back over these
lapse of years, one can easily see what he might have been,
and how painfully he fell short. The grace of humility
never adorned his character for long. He could not see
that in God's sight he was less than least, for him it was
impossible&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To lay his intellectual treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the low footstool of the Crucified."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Egidio always remained faithful to his first trust. He
also never wavered, never looked back. In the different
glimpses we get of his life, we see very clearly the mode of
living prescribed by Francis. His intention was never
that his disciples were to live on charity, but that they
should work for their bread, money being totally forbidden.
Work brought them down to the level of the common
people, and on the same plane they could more easily reach
their hearts and consciences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Question.</i></div>

<p>Egidio, refined and educated though he undoubtedly was,
seems to have been able to put his hand to anything. When
on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he was detained at Brindisi,
he borrowed a water jug, and, filling it, went round the town
selling water, and crying "Fresh water! Fresh water!"
like any of the ordinary water-carriers. On his way back
he procured willows, and made baskets, which he sold to
supply himself with food. He was always very particular
not to take more than he considered was fair for his work.</p>

<p>Obedience was another of Egidio's strong points. He
believed in his call, he believed in Francis, he never
questioned an order, even when it was manifestly not
altogether a wise instruction he received, he still considered
that "obedience was better than sacrifice."</p>

<p>Masseo appears to have had very little idea what kind
of a life he was entering upon, when he first joined the
band. He was not a spiritual man by nature, but by
degrees he learned to look at the inside of things instead
of the outside, and to know a little of the mind of God.
Masseo was big and handsome, with a decided gift of speech.
We are told that because of his physical attractions the
people always gave to him the nicest and daintiest portions
of food. It was a matter of no little wonderment to him
when he discovered that for all a certain kind of people
were attracted by his appearance, yet he had little or no
power to convict them of sin, and make them long to be
good. Francis by this time had lost all his good looks
and become pale and worn and thin with work. Masseo
compared himself with Francis greatly to his superior's
disadvantage. At last one day he said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why is it? Why is it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Francis.</p>

<p>"I mean to ask thee," said Masseo, "why all the
world goes after thee? Why all men wish to see thee, to
hear thee, and to obey thy word? Thou art not handsome,
nor learned, nor of noble birth. How is it then that men
go after thee?"</p>

<p>The answer which Masseo received, made him see what
kind of a character he had come in contact with, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that day there was no more faithful and adoring disciple
than handsome Masseo.</p>

<p>"Would you know the reason why all men come after
me?" asked Francis. "It is because the Lord has not
found among men, a more wicked, a more imperfect, or a
greater sinner that I am, and to accomplish the wonderful
work He intends doing, He has not found a creature more
vile than I upon earth; for this reason He has chosen me
to confound beauty, greatness, birth, and all the science of
the world, that man may learn that every good gift comes
from Him, and not from the creature, that all may glory in
the Lord!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sylvester's Avarice.</i></div>

<p>Sylvester was the first priest who joined Francis.
Though a priest, he was possessed of very little true
religion, and was inclined to be somewhat avaricious.
When Francis was rebuilding St. Damian, Sylvester had
sold him some stones, for which he had been well paid.
Now, he happened to be among the crowd in the market-place
when Bernardo was distributing his fortune, and
it occurred to him that he would get some of it for himself.
So going up to Francis, he said,</p>

<p>"Brother, you did not pay me very well for the stones
which you bought of me."</p>

<p>Francis, who had not a spark of avarice in his nature,
handed him a handful of coins without stopping to count
them, saying,</p>

<p>"Here, are you sufficiently paid now?"</p>

<p>"It is enough, my brother," said Sylvester, taking the
money and moving off.</p>

<p>But from that hour he never knew a moment's peace.
His action haunted him, he could neither sleep by night
nor rest by day. The difference between Francis and
Bernardo and himself came vividly before him, he repented
of his sin, and as soon as ever his affairs would permit&mdash;about
a year later&mdash;he joined Francis.</p>

<p>There are some historians who declare that Ginepro was
mad. The majority, however, dispute this, and say that
what looked like madness was simply zeal&mdash;zeal, perhaps
untempered with discretion. Ginepro was devoted, self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>sacrificing
and faithful. He mourned over his mistakes,
and was always ready to acknowledge himself in the wrong.
It was with the greatest difficulty that he was taught that
he mustn't give away anything, and everything he could
lay hands on. When he saw anyone poor or ill-clothed, he
would immediately take off his clothes and hand them over.
He was at last strictly forbidden to do this. A few days
later, he met a poor man who begged from him.</p>

<p>"I have nothing," said Ginepro, in great compassion,
"which I could give thee but my tunic, and I am under
orders not to give that away. But if thou wilt take it off
my back I will not resist thee."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done, and Ginepro returned home
tunicless. When questioned he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"A good man took it off my back and went away with
it."</p>

<p>It was necessary to clear everything portable out of
Ginepro's way, because whatever he could lay his hands on
he gave to the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Almost a Murder.</i></div>

<p>His great humility on one occasion nearly led him to
the gallows. There was a cruel tyrant named Nicolas,
a nobleman living near Viterbo, whom all the town hated.
This man had been warned that someone would come in
the guise of a poor beggar and take his life. Nicolas gave
orders that the castle was to be strictly guarded. A few
days later luckless Ginepro appeared in the vicinity of
the castle. On the way thither some young men had
seized him, torn his cloak, and covered him with dust, so
that he was a sight to behold for rags and dirt! As
soon as he came near the castle he was taken as a
suspicious character and cruelly beaten. He was asked
who he was.</p>

<p>"I am a great sinner," was the answer. He certainly
looked like a ruffian!</p>

<p>When further asked his designs he explained,</p>

<p>"I am a great traitor, and unworthy of any mercy."</p>

<p>Then they asked if he meant to burn the castle and kill
Nicolas.</p>

<p>"Worse things than these would I do, only for God,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
he replied. Such a hardened, boldfaced criminal never
stood before a bar!</p>

<p>He was taken, tied to a horse's tail, and dragged through
the town to the gallows. If it had not been for the intervention
of a good man in the crowd, who knew the friars,
he would have been hung.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ginepro's Dinner.</i></div>

<p>"Brother Ginepro," said one of the friars one day, "we
are all going out, and by the time we come back will you
have got us a little refreshment?"</p>

<p>"Most willingly," said Ginepro, "leave it to me."</p>

<p>Out he went with a sack, and asked food from door to
door for his brethren. Soon he was well laden and
returned home.</p>

<p>"What a pity it is," said Ginepro to himself, as he
put on two great pots, "that a brother should be lost in
the kitchen! I shall cook enough dinner to serve us for two
weeks to come, and then we'll give ourselves to prayer."</p>

<p>So saying, he piled in everything, salt meat, fresh
meat, eggs in their shells, chickens with the feathers
on, and vegetables. One of the friars who returned
before the others, was amazed to see the two enormous
pots on a roaring fire with Ginepro poking at them alternately,
protected from the heat by a board he had fastened
round his neck. At last dinner was ready, and, pouring
it out before the hungry friars, he said complacently,</p>

<p>"Eat a good dinner now, and then we'll go to prayer,
there'll be no more cooking for a long time to come, for I
have cooked enough for a fortnight."</p>

<p>Alas! one historian informs us, "there was never a hog
in the campagna of Rome so hungry that he could have
eaten it."</p>

<p>But, in spite of all the curious tales we read about the
blunderings of this simple soul, his name has been handed
down through the ages as that of a saint; for the highway
of holiness is such that a wayfaring man, though a fool,
shall not err therein.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A True Franciscan.</i></div>

<p>Leo, whom they called "the little sheep of God," who
became Francis' secretary, was one of the best loved of the
disciples. In Leo, Francis' soul found rest and help and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
comfort. His nature was simple, affectionate and refined,
and in every respect he was a true Franciscan.</p>

<p>There are others whose names we find among the early
Franciscans, but the foregoing are those who stand out
most prominently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Francis&mdash;Called to be a Saint.</span></h3>

<div class="poem0"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God's interpreter art thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the waiting ones below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt them and its light midway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heralding the better day."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>We have seen Francis as a young man, gay, careless,
pleasure loving, kind-hearted, a leader at every feast and
revel, known to his companions as a thorough good fellow.
We have watched the first strivings of the Holy Spirit in his
soul, and marked his earnest attempts to follow the light
that then began to penetrate his hitherto dark soul. We
have followed that glimmering light with him, step by
step, seen him persecuted, mocked, stoned, beaten, watched
his lonely wilderness wrestlings when there was no human
eye to pity, no human arm to succour. We have seen, too,
how, little by little, this thorny pathway led to a closer and
more intimate acquaintance with God, for which acquaintance
Francis counted his sufferings as nothing, and the
world well lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>"Saint" Francis.</i></div>

<p>Francis was not an extraordinary character in any
sense of the word. He was what he was simply and solely
by the grace of God, which is ever free for all men. He was
not a man created for the hour. He was a vessel, cleansed
and emptied, and thus fit for the Master's use, and God
used him, as He always uses such vessels. The whole
secret of his sainthood lay in his simple, loving, implicit
obedience. Not the lifeless obedience that one renders to
inexorable law, but the heart-felt, passionate desire to
serve, and to anticipate the lightest want of the One
Object of the affections! That baptism of personal love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
for God and union with Christ was poured out upon
Francis in the black hour of what looked to him complete
failure; when hunted and pursued, he sought refuge from
his angry friends in the caves of the earth. The gift that he
then received he never ceased to guard and cherish, and
other blessings were added to it, for God has promised, "To
him that hath it shall be given." And God gave liberally,
good measure, pressed down, and running over. But the
gifts which were Francis are ours too, by right of grace
Divine&mdash;to be had for the faithful seeking, and kept by
pure, faithful, and obedient living&mdash;"Called to be saints."
The few? One here and there in every century? Oh, no.
"Called to be saints," are the myriad souls who have
received the Divine touch of regeneration. This is the
calling and election of the redeemed; but oh, how few
there are that make them <i>sure</i>!</p>

<p>Five years had now elapsed since that spring morning,
when, weak and ill from fever, Francis dragged himself out
of doors, to look again on the glorious landscape that he
thought would bring him health and healing. The story of
his disappointment we have already told. During those
five years Francis made gigantic strides in heavenly
wisdom and knowledge, and we feel that we cannot do
better than to pause in our narrative and try to give you
some idea of the spiritual personality of the man, whose
name even now the people were beginning to couple with
that of "saint."</p>

<p>In appearance Francis was a thorough Italian. He was
rather below than over the ordinary height, his eyes and
hair were dark, and his bearing free and gracious. He was
chiefly remarkable for his happy, joyous expression. This
he never lost: even when illness had robbed him of his good
looks, the light in his eyes, and the smile on his lips were
always the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Holy Boldness.</i></div>

<p>The most striking points of Francis' character are, perhaps,
his humility, his sincerity, and his childlike simplicity.
Humble Francis was not by nature. There was
nothing in his training to make him so, and everything
that would tend to the growth of pride and arrogance. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with his conversion, humility became one of his strongest
convictions. He truly considered himself less than the least,
and he held it to be an offence against God if he ever let
himself, or his little feelings and prejudices, stand in the way
of accomplishing what he believed to be for the extension
of the Kingdom. It seemed as though he had no feelings to
be hurt. What most people would call justifiable sensitiveness,
Francis would call sin. He went straight to the
mark, and if he did not accomplish all he wanted to at first,
he simply tried again, and generally succeeded sooner or
later.</p>

<p>In places where the Friars were not known, Francis often
found it a little difficult to get permission to preach in the
churches. At a place called Imola, for instance, where he
went to ask the bishop for the use of the church, the
bishop replied, coldly and distantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brother, I preach in my own parish; I am not in
need of anyone to aid me in my task."</p>

<p>Francis bowed, and went out. An hour later, he
presented himself again.</p>

<p>"What have you come for again?" asked the bishop,
angrily. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Francis, in his simple way,
"when a father turns his son out of one door, the son has
but one thing to do&mdash;to return by another."</p>

<p>This holy boldness won the bishop's heart.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said. "You and your brothers may
preach in my diocese. I give you a general permission to
do so. Your humility deserves nothing less!"</p>

<p>Francis never considered himself at liberty to "shake the
dust" of a city off his feet unless he had tried and tried
again and again, to get a hearing there; indeed, nothing
convinced him of the uselessness of his quest unless he
were thrown out neck and crop, then it was more than
likely he would gather himself up, and try another
entrance! He entirely forgot himself in his love for his
Master.</p>

<p>His love of truth was with him almost a passion.
Between his thoughts, and his words, and his actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
there was a perfect agreement, neither one contradicted the
other; he saw to it that it was so, knowing that nothing
hurt the Gospel of Christ like insincerity or double dealing.
Distractions in prayer he looked upon as secret lies, and
saying with the lips what the heart did not go with.</p>

<p>"How shameful," he used to say, "to allow oneself to
fall into vain distractions when one is addressing the great
King! We should not speak in that manner even to a
respectable man!"</p>

<p>On one occasion he had carved a little olive-wood vase,
probably meaning to sell it for food. But, while at prayer
one day, some thought connected with this work came into
his mind, distracting his soul for the moment. Instantly
he was full of contrition, and, as soon as he left his prayer,
hastened to put his vase into the fire, where never again it
could come between his soul and God!</p>

<p>One day, on meeting a friend on the road, they stopped to
converse. On parting, the friend said, "You will pray for
me?" To which Francis replied, "Willingly." Hardly
was the other out of sight, when Francis said to his
companion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait a little for me; I am going to kneel down and
discharge the obligation I have just contracted." This
was always his habit. Instead of promising and forgetting
as so many do, he never rested till he had fulfilled the
promise he had made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Fox-skin.</i></div>

<p>During the last two years of his life he was often very
weak and ailing. One cold winter, his companion, seeing
that the clothes he was wearing were very thin and patched,
was filled with compassion on his account. He secretly
got a piece of fox-skin.</p>

<p>"My father," he said, showing him the skin, "you
suffer very much from your liver and stomach; I beg of you
let me sew this fur under your tunic. If, you will not have
it all, let it at least cover your stomach."</p>

<p>"I will do what you wish," said Francis; "but you
must sew as large a piece <i>outside</i> as in."</p>

<p>His companion couldn't see any sense in this arrangement,
and objected very strongly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"The reason is quite plain," said Francis: "The outside
piece will show everybody that I allow myself this
comfort." They had to give in at last, and Francis had
his way.</p>

<p>"Oh, admirable man," writes a friend after his death;
"thou hast always been the same within and without, in
words and in deeds, below and above!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Temptation.</i></div>

<p>On another occasion, he tore off his tunic, because, for a
brief moment of weakness, he harbored the thought that he
might have led an easier life, and still serve God. Like other
men, he might have had a settled home, and lived a tranquil
existence. It was a passing temptation, but Francis,
tearing off his coarse garment, emblem of the Cross that he
strove to follow, cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a religious habit&mdash;a man given up to such thoughts
would be a robber if he wore it." Nor did he put it on
again till he felt he could do so with a pure heart and clean
conscience.</p>

<p>With the crystal transparency of his inner and outer life
went a simplicity that was akin to that of a little child.
His sermons and addresses were of the very simplest and
plainest. Though Francis was undoubtedly one of the
orators of the age, his fiery words and burning language
were such that even the most unlearned could easily
follow. His theme was simply Christ, and Christ crucified
for our sins, and an exhortation to repentance and holy
living. Learned ones pondered his words and marvelled
wherein lay his power, little dreaming that his very plainness
of speech was his strength.</p>

<p>His delight in the beauties of nature never left him.
Sunset and sunrise, mountain and plain, river and sea
alike, filled him with joy, and all spoke to him of the glory
of God. Flowers always gave him especial pleasure. He
insisted that his disciples should always reserve some
portion of their gardens for the growth of flowers as well as
vegetables, "to give them a foretaste of the eternal sweetness
of Heaven." When the brethren went to the fields to
chop wood, Francis always warned them to take care of the
roots, so that the trunk might sprout again and live. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
take life of any kind was intolerable to him. For this
reason he always lifted the worms out of his path and laid
them at the side of the road, lest an incautious traveller
might crush them.</p>

<p>His love and power over animals are almost too well
known to need mention. He always spoke of them as his
brothers and sisters. He disdained nothing. All were to
him alike beautiful, because the work of his God. For a
long time, he had a tame sheep, that followed him about
wherever it could get a chance. This sheep always seemed
to know exactly how to behave under all circumstances.
When the brethren knelt at prayers, it knelt too; when
they sang, it joined in with a not-too-loud little bleat!</p>

<p>Near his room, at the Portiuncula, there lived a grasshopper
in a fig-vine. This little insect would hop on his
finger at his bidding, and when told to "sing and praise
the Lord," used to chirp with all its might! Birds, insects,
and even fishes and wild animals, we are told, all recognized
in Francis a friend, and readily did his bidding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Two Small Mites.</i></div>

<p>Francis' love for God was supreme, and his belief that
God loved him never wavered. To make people love and
know God was his one burning desire. It was not so much
God's service he delighted in as God Himself. He never
lost sight of the Master in the Work, and to a large extent
this was the key to all his success. His work was the outcome
of his love. After we have received, the first natural
impulse is to give. Francis possessed "two small mites,"
an ancient historian writes&mdash;"they were his body and his
soul. He gave them both, bravely and freely, according to
his custom."</p>

<p>Whatever came&mdash;joy, sorrow, success, failure, pain,
weariness, sickness, insult, or favor&mdash;Francis took as direct
from the hand of God, and blessed Him for all. Why
shouldn't he? His heart was right, he had the assurance
that his ways pleased God, and his faith was not dependent
upon knowledge. He was content, nay, glad to trust where
he could not see, confident in the belief that "nothing
could hurt a sanctified soul." His disciples could not
always follow him so far. Some of them, when they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
their master suffering&mdash;as he did suffer severely in his last
days&mdash;thought that God might have led His beloved Home
by a less painful road. One of them once gave expression
to his feelings thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, my brother, pray to the Lord that He may treat
you more gently. Truly, He ought to let His hand weigh
less heavily upon you."</p>

<p>Hurt to the quick, as well as indignant, Francis cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is that you are saying? If I did not know your
simplicity I should henceforth hold you in horror! What!
you have the audacity to blame God's dealings with me!"
Then, throwing himself on his knees, he prayed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord God! I give Thee thanks for all these
pains I endure. I pray Thee to send me a hundredfold
more if such be Thy good pleasure! I willingly accept all
afflictions. Thy holy name is my superabundant joy!"</p>

<p>Nothing could ever make Francis say that anything in
his lot was "very hard." His love was too loyal, his trust
too complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rejoice Always.</i></div>

<p>Joy was one of his cardinal articles of faith. "Rejoice
always!" was a divine command, and one not to be overlooked.
As a young man, he had been of a bright,
joyous nature, but easily plunged into depths of sadness and
melancholy. God taught him upon what to base his joy,
and, when he had torn down all earthly external devices,
led him to derive his all from the true source. He held
joy to be the normal state of those whom God loves&mdash;the
fruit of Christian life, without which everything languishes
and dies.</p>

<p>"The devil," Francis always said, "carries dust with
him, and whenever he can, he throws it into the openings
of the soul in order to cloud the clearness of its thoughts
and the purity of its actions. If joy knows how to defend
itself and subsist, then he has had his spite for nothing;
but if the servant of Christ becomes sad, bitter or unhappy,
he is sure to triumph. Sooner or later, that soul will be
overwhelmed by its sadness, or will seek for false joys or
consolations. The servant of God who is troubled for any
reason" (Francis always allowed that causes for trouble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
this world are innumerable) "must immediately have
recourse to prayer, and remain in the presence of his
Heavenly Father till the joy of salvation has been restored
to him, otherwise, his sadness will increase and engender
a rust in the soul."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Duty of Cheerfulness.</i></div>

<p>This duty of cheerfulness Francis impressed upon all
with whom he had to do.</p>

<p>"My brother," he said to a friar, of doleful countenance,
one day, "if thou hast some fault to mourn, do it in secret,
groan and weep before God, but here, with thy brethren, be
as they are in tone and countenance."</p>

<p>His conviction of this duty was so strong that, during
one large gathering of the friars, he had this advice
written in large letters and posted up.</p>

<p>"Let the brethren avoid ever appearing sombre, sad and
clouded, like the hypocrites, but let them always be found
joyful in the Lord, gay, amiable, gracious&mdash;as is fitting."</p>

<p>Amiability and graciousness he also considered amongst
the virtues&mdash;courtesy, he called it. And courtesy he always
said was akin to charity, her younger sister, who was to go
with the elder one and help to open all hearts to her! An
historian writes thus of Francis: "He was very courteous
and gracious in all things, and possessed a peace and
serenity that nothing could disturb. This sympathy and
benevolence was expressed on his countenance; his face
had in it something angelic."</p>

<p>His songs and hymns were the outcome of his perpetual
joy in the Lord. In those days there were no popular
religious hymns or songs. People praised God in Latin,
with psalms and chants. Francis never found that these
gave vent to his feelings, and so, with the help of one of
the brothers&mdash;Pacificus, a trained musician&mdash;he began to
write his own; and soon, wherever the friars passed, they
left a train of simple melody in their wake. It was Francis,
and his brethren, who first turned the Italian language into
poetry, and gave it that impetus which has since rendered
it the typical language for song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Francis&mdash;as a Leader of Men.</span></h3>

<div class="poem3"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou whose bright faith makes feeble hearts grow stronger,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sends fresh warriors to the great campaign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bids the lone convert feel estranged no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wins the sundered to be one again."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Little did Francis think, as he piled up stone after
stone upon the walls of St. Damian, that the day was not
far distant when he should begin the building of a
spiritual temple, built up of "lively stones," with Christ
Himself as the "chief corner-stone." Yet it was even so.
That day when, in obedience to the heavenly command,
he stripped off his shoes and mantle, he laid the first
stone. From that hour his spiritual building proceeded,
and he who had fancied his work completed, found that it
was but barely begun! Dead souls, in whom the Story
of the Cross could no longer arouse even the most transient
emotion, were awakened and convicted when they saw it
lived out before them&mdash;a living epistle. We have seen
how souls quickened by Divine power, and led only by God,
came and joined themselves to Francis, choosing him as
their leader, and accepting as their rule of life the
revelation made to him, through the gospel, for that
memorable February day. To those that followed Francis,
God made no more definite manifestation of His will other
than that they were to join themselves to him and lead
his life. Manifestly, he was their God-appointed leader,
and as simply and obediently as he had pulled off his
mantle and shoes, he accepted the human trust bestowed
upon him. And well he fulfilled that trust!</p>

<p>To the very last hour of his life, Francis was true to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
first principles. Never for one moment did he wander out
of the narrow path in which God had set his feet at the
beginning of his career as a leader and teacher of men.
As literally as it was possible he modelled his life on that
of our Lord Jesus Christ. One of the most noted Atheist
writers of the present century says that in no age has there
been so close a copy of the life of Christ as that portrayed
by Francis and his followers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Alms.</i></div>

<p>The most well-known of all the Franciscan characteristics
is their poverty. Though at times they asked alms
for Christ's sake from their neighbours, that was not the
ideal Francis had before him as their regular mode of life.
It was that all should work with their hands at whatever
they could best do, and in return receive an equivalent for
their labour in food or clothes. "All the brothers who
have learnt a trade," Francis said, "will exercise it, those
who have not must learn one, and keep to the exercise of
it without changing. All will receive everything necessary
for the support of life, except money, in remuneration of
their work." "When the brothers are in want of the
necessaries of life, they shall go and ask for alms like any
other poor man," was another of his directions. This was
a great trial to some who would have gladly learned the
most menial of trades. But there were times when there
was no demand for labor, and there was nothing for it but
to beg or starve. This latter Francis would not allow,
and, repugnant though the former might be, it had to be
done. Not that he ever forced anyone. He began by
doing this ignominious duty himself, saying as he did
so&mdash;</p>

<p>"My beloved brethren, the Son of God was far more
noble than the noblest of us, and yet He became poor upon
earth. It is for love of Him that we have embraced
poverty, therefore, we must not be ashamed to resort to
the table of our Lord (thus he always spoke of alms).
Rejoice then to give good examples to those brethren
whose firstfruits ye are, that they in future may have
nothing to do but follow you."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Holy Poverty.</i></div>

<p>But there were other reasons why Francis was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
devoted to poverty. In all his doings he is remarkable for
clear common-sense. Money and possessions of any kind
were in those days a fruitful source of dispute and quarrels
of all kinds; therefore, as Francis reasoned, it were better
that the Knights of Christ should possess nothing. Then
again in the priesthood, though the individuals themselves
possessed nothing, yet large sums of money and great
possessions had been amassed by convent and monastery,
until, at the period of which we are writing, the luxury and
gluttony of priest and monk was a favourite joke, and
the splendour of their buildings well-known. As to
buildings, Francis would very much have preferred to have
none. Since this was impossible, he had everything built
at the least possible expense. Just rough beams put
together, and the joinings filled with sand. Even then
this uncouth mass had to be property of someone outside
the community!</p>

<p>"Only on this condition," Francis said, "can we be
considered as strangers here below in accordance with the
apostolic recommendation." Certainly, no one could accuse
them of luxury. The furniture of the houses was of the
poorest. Beds, often of straw, cups and plates of wood or
clay, a few rough tables, and a small number of books in
common to the brothers, were all the rooms contained.
Carefully and jealously did Francis guard against the first
appearance of relaxation on the part of himself or his
followers. He would have thought God's commands to
him broken if any new-comer found in his community anything
that he had given up upon leaving the world.</p>

<p>As to clothing, we have already seen what were Francis'
views in this respect. The rough robe of "beast color,"
tied in with a knotted rope, is still to be seen to-day in
many parts of the world. But Francis very well knew
that a certain kind of vanity can easily lurk in even the
coarsest of garments. He was, therefore, constantly on
the watch, and was always severe if he saw the least
deviation from the rule. "It is an infallible sign," he
always said, "that fervour is cooling in the soul." He
never allowed his disciples to have more than two tunics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may be that one suffers a little," he said, "but
what sort of virtue is that that cannot suffer anything! To
try and avoid all mortifications under plea of necessity is a
cowardly way of losing occasions of merit. It is what the
Hebrews would have done had they gone back to Egypt."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fatherly Care.</i></div>

<p>It was more by personal example than anything else
that Francis led his followers in the Divine steps that he
was so confident had been also marked out for him. And
his people believed in him and loved him. They were convinced
that through him spoke the Divine voice, and that
his way was God's way. And he was worthy of their belief
and their love and their esteem. He loved them with
a devoted, generous love. By his entire forgetfulness of
self and his constant devotion to their needs, he was theirs,
always to "serve." Many stories are told of his gentle,
delicate kindliness and fatherly care. Once, one of his
flock had gone a little too far in depriving himself of
natural food. That night, in the silence, came a voice
from his room which groaned softly, "I am starving, I am
starving of hunger!" Francis, who was awake, rose
quietly, and, getting together some food, went to the
starving brother and invited him to eat with him, so as not
to hurt his feelings or let it appear that he had been overheard.
After he had eaten, he explained to him the evil
of not giving the body what was necessary for it.</p>

<p>Another brother, who was ill, had a great longing for
grapes, but feared to indulge himself in case he should be
breaking his vows. Francis found out, some way or other,
how he felt, and, going to him, led him out into a vineyard,
and, gathering some rich clusters, seated himself on
the ground, and, beginning to eat, invited his companion
to join him. If any were weak and ailing, it was always
Francis who was first to take a vessel and go out and beg
for more nourishing food for his ailing comrades. A
mother could not have been more tender than he was.</p>

<p>In a very great measure Francis possessed the discernment
of spirits. He seemed to know intuitively what people
were thinking about. One day, during the last years
of his life, when he had been obliged through bodily weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>ness
to ride on an ass, he surprised the brother who was
trudging alongside him, by getting off and saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Francis' Tact.</i></div>

<p>"Here, brother, get on, it is more fitting that you, who
are of noble birth, should ride, rather than I, who am of
humble origin."</p>

<p>The brother immediately fell on his knees and, asking
forgiveness, confessed that he had been grumbling to himself
that he, whose family would never have had anything
to do with that of Pietro Bernardone's, had been obliged to
follow the ass of Francis Bernardone!</p>

<p>Another brother was greatly troubled because he thought
Francis did not love him. He told himself that Francis
hardly ever noticed or spoke to him, and then he began to
argue that probably God, too, paid no attention to him. He
determined to see his leader about it. As soon as ever he
appeared before Francis, and before he could get out a
word, Francis said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a temptation, my brother, believe me, it is a
temptation. I have the truest affection for you, and you
deserve this affection. Come to me whenever you want,
and we will talk things over."</p>

<p>One can easily imagine the joy of the once forlorn brother!</p>

<p>Not only could Francis move the crowds and hold them
spell-bound with his fiery words, but he had also the power
to reach and touch men's hearts in private. He was
always accessible to that individual, be he saint or sinner,
who was in need. In times of darkness and depression,
he was the support of the brothers. He knew well
the stages that a soul passes through after it has taken the
final step of separateness from the world. In critical
moments he was theirs to soothe and comfort with prayer
and advice. It was not only the faltering saint that he
lavished his tenderness upon; he was just as careful of the
faulty and ungrateful, and nothing could exceed the love
with which he strove to lure them back when he saw they
were inclined to go ever so little astray. "A superior," he
used to say, "is more of a tyrant than a father if he waits
to interfere until a fault has been committed or a fall has
occurred!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>No Alternative.</i></div>

<p>However, in spite of his tenderness, Francis could be
iron strong when there was any question of right and
wrong. Those who were not of his mind were obliged to
get out from among the brothers. There was no alternative,
no easier way made for anyone. "Little Brothers" or
"Friars Minor" they called themselves, a name which
then meant "servant of all" or "least of all," and woe
betide anyone who departed from the spirit of this name!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Establishment of the Order.</span></h3>

<div class="poem4"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Would you know, oh world, these Warriors; Go where the poor, the old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask for pardon and for heaven, and you offer food and gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With healing and with comfort, with words of peace and prayer,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>It was not long before the little hut by the Riva Torto
was full to overflowing. The number of brethren had increased
so, that there was only just space for them to lie
down at night, each under the beam upon which his name
had been chalked. It was a poor abode enough, but poor
though it was, they were not destined to have its shelter
long. One day when they were all engaged in prayer, a
peasant noisily threw open the door, and driving his ass
right on top of the kneeling occupants cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go in, go in, Bruno, we shall be better off here."</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but get out. The hut was not
theirs, and neither was there room for an extra man and
a beast! They next betook themselves to the Portiuncula,
where they built themselves huts or cells. The Portiuncula
was the last church that Francis restored, and one
always especially dear to him. A little later it was given
to the friars for their own use.</p>

<p>From the Portiuncula the brothers travelled all round
the country-side, two by two, in true apostolic fashion.
Some followed the peasants into the fields, and as they
shared their labors, sang and talked of the love of Christ.
For days, perhaps, they would live and eat and sleep with
the field hands, and then pass, always singing, on their
way, leaving hearts that had been touched, behind them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Others sought the lazar-house, and spent their time in
helping the brothers tend the sick. They were always
welcome here, and very often difficult cases were reserved
for their care. In the towns they met with a very
different reception. There they were considered "fair
game" for anybody who wished to tease or persecute or
mock them. Some people called them mad and lazy,
others who believed in their good intent said that if they
wanted to be religious, there were plenty of Orders they
could join which would not be so austere. Even the
Bishop of Assisi, who always called Francis his son, said
to him once,</p>

<p>"Your way of living, without owning anything, seems
to me very harsh and difficult."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>On the Right Lines.</i></div>

<p>Francis, sure that he was on the right lines, replied,</p>

<p>"If we possessed property we should have need of arms
for its defence, for it is the source of quarrels and lawsuits,
and the love of God and one's neighbor usually finds
many obstacles therein! This is why we do not desire
temporal goods."</p>

<p>As the months went on, Francis and his doings attracted
more and more attention. They were the talk of the
country. The families of those brothers who had given
away their possessions could not forgive them for so doing,
and attacks from these quarters were bitter and severe.
Disappointed heirs could find nothing too evil to say
against the foolishness and madness of their friar relatives.
From this point of view, many families found the brotherhood
very alarming, and parents trembled when their sons
took any interest in it, lest they too should join it. The
clergy naturally felt somewhat distrustful of the doings of
these strange lay-workers. So, taking it altogether,
whether he liked it or not, Francis was the most talked of
man in Assisi. The more people flocked to him and got
converted, the more his enemies slandered him.</p>

<p>It was this state of things that led him to take his
entire force&mdash;numbering twelve&mdash;to Rome, and there beg
the Pope to sanction their mode of work. It was a bold
undertaking, and when it was first presented to the twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
they shrank back in horror at the presumption of such a
thing! But Francis had made up his mind and nothing
could move him.</p>

<p>How was he, Francis, young, without any interest, and
a stranger to all churchly usages, to get to see the Pope?
the brethren asked him.</p>

<p>Francis didn't know. Probably he cared less. Anyway,
God had told him to go.</p>

<p>Then the brethren pleaded their simplicity. How they
should look&mdash;travel-stained, bare-footed, and coarse-robed,
at the court of Rome! This argument carried no weight
whatever with their leader, and his faith prevailing, they
set out. Just as they were about to start, Francis said
"Let us choose one of us to be our Chief. We will go
whither he wills to go, we will sojourn where he wills us
to sojourn." The rest agreeing, Bernardo di Quintavelle
was chosen as leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bishop Guido.</i></div>

<p>As soon as they arrived in Rome they discovered that
unexpected help was right at hand. Guido, the good
Bishop of Assisi, was in the city, and he met them
accidentally just as they arrived. He was a little discomposed
at first&mdash;seeing the entire brotherhood he immediately
jumped to the conclusion that they were about to
settle in Rome. However, Francis soon told him the
object of their journey, and he promised to do the very
best he could for them. Guido had a friend in Rome,
Cardinal John, of Sabina. This man was godly and
devoted, one who had never been carried away by the
grandeur of his position, and he was always a friend of
anybody who tried to work for God. Guido had already
told him the story of Francis, and said that it was his
belief that God meant to do great things through that
simple man and his followers. Now that they had turned
up so unexpectedly, he hastened to introduce them to John
and let him judge them for himself. The Cardinal saw
them, and talked to them, and was convinced in his own
mind that they were divinely led. Still, he thought he
would like to try Francis a little further. Taking him to
one side, he asked him a number of questions about his
work and its difficulties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is beyond your strength," he said, when he had
heard him, and went on to advise him to join some already
existing Order, or else, if he liked, lead the life of a hermit.
Francis listened politely, but still kept to his purpose.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," persisted the Cardinal. "It is much
better to follow the beaten tracks."</p>

<p>Francis, equally persistent, kept to his point, and then
the Cardinal, who would have been sorry had his advice
been taken, entered heartily into his plans, and promised
to support him with the Pope.</p>

<p>As these interviews occupied several days, Francis
became impatient at the delay. Nobody knows how he
did it, but he succeeded unaided in getting into the Palace,
and presenting himself and his brethren before the
astonished eyes of the Pope! The Pope was walking in a
secluded gallery, meditating mournfully on the declension
of the Church of God, and trying to think what would
remedy the growing evils, when his meditations were
abruptly cut short by what looked to him like a troop of
beggars. He was annoyed, and sent them off about their
business before they could explain what they wanted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Dream.</i></div>

<p>That night the Pope dreamed a strange dream. He
thought he saw a tiny palm tree spring up at his feet,
which immediately grew and grew till it became a splendid
tree. When he awoke, the conviction was strong in his
mind that the poor man he had turned away the day before
was none other than this little tree. And as he was
thinking over his dream, Cardinal John came in, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have found a man whom I look upon as very perfect.
He is resolved to follow literally the teachings of Christ,
and I have no doubt that God intends to make use of him
to reanimate faith on the earth."</p>

<p>The Pope was struck with what he said, for he was convinced
in his own mind that this was none other than the
man he had driven away. He concealed his feelings from
the Cardinal, and merely said he should like to see him.
The Cardinal sent for Francis and his twelve, who speedily
appeared, and the Pope saw at once they were the beggars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of yesterday. He welcomed Francis warmly, and went
into the rule he had drawn up for his life, and that of his
brotherhood. This rule has not come down to us, but
from various sources we learn that it was merely a
string of Bible verses, Christ's directions to His apostles,
including those that had been Francis' own commission.
The Pope listened to all that Francis had to say, then he
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hesitation.</i></div>

<p>"My children, the life to which you aspire seems hard
and difficult. Doubtless your fervor is great, and we have
no anxiety on your account, but it is our duty to consider
those who will come after you. We must not impose upon
them a burden they cannot bear. All this requires serious
reflection." Then he dismissed them, saying he would lay
the matter before the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Well, the question was put to the Cardinals, and they
talked and talked and talked. One said one thing, another
said another, and most of them had some objection to
raise. They said he went beyond due limits, that human
nature could not long endure such a life, and altogether
they showed by their conversation, how very, very far they,
the leaders of a Church who claimed to follow the steps of
the lowly Nazarene, had departed from the initial simplicity
of the Gospel. Probably some idea of this sort was
in Cardinal John's mind when he rose to address the
Assembly. He did not say very much, but what he said
went straight to the point.</p>

<p>"If we refuse the petition of this poor man on the plea
that his rule is difficult, let us beware lest we reject the
Gospel itself, for the rule which he desires us to approve of
is in conformity with the teachings of the Gospel. For us
to say that Gospel perfection contains anything unreasonable
or impossible is to rise up against the author of the
Gospel and blaspheme Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>The force of his words went home, more especially as
the rule was entirely composed of Scripture verses!</p>

<p>Still the Pope hesitated. He could not come to any
immediate decision.</p>

<p>"Go my son," he said to Francis, "and pray to God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
that He may let you know that what you ask is from Him,
and if it is we will grant your desire."</p>

<p>For several days Francis gave himself up to prayer, and
his next interview with the Pope convinced him that these
poor beggars had a mission from God. He withheld his
approval no longer. Embracing Francis, he said to the
little band&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go with God's blessing and preach repentance to all,
in the way that He is pleased to inspire you with."</p>

<p>A few days later the little party were on their way home
again, overflowing with joy. For a fortnight they lingered
in a little town called Orte. Some historians say they rested
awhile from their labours, others that they were attacked
with fever in crossing the Campagna. Be that as it may,
it was here that Francis endured one of the severest
temptations of his life. The beauty of the scenery, the
delicious quiet, after the anxious time he had just gone
through in Rome, all conspired to make him think that after
all perhaps a life hidden from the world and devoted to prayer
and meditation would be just as acceptable to God as the
more laborious one of preaching and teaching. But he
did not remain long under this spell, and in a little time
they were all back in Assisi.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Order Established.</i></div>

<p>It was at this point that Francis began first to shine as
an orator. Of course the news of his visit to Rome spread
all around, and more than ever he was an object of interest.
The priests of St. George, who had educated him, asked
him to preach in their church. This service must have
been a success, because when the Bishop Guido returned
to Assisi, he asked Francis to preach in the cathedral.
Here Francis surpassed anything he had ever done before,
and the large cathedral was too small to hold the crowds
that flocked to hear the young man. Men and women
came in from all the country-side, monks came down from
their mountain monasteries, and learned and simple all
agreed that "never man spake like this man!"</p>

<p>Yet, as we have said before, his words were of the
simplest. He preached repentance, not merely a lip
repentance, but kind that worked itself out in daily life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
"If you have defrauded any man," he said, "restore unto
him that which is his." This sort of plain, practical
teaching was rapidly dying out. It came fresh to the
people, and they were stirred mightily."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Less than the Least.</i></div>

<p>After their return from Rome, they began to be known as
the Friars Minor. This was the way in which they got
their name. One day a brother was reading aloud the
Rule of the Order, and when he came to this passage,
"and let the brothers be less than all others," it struck
Francis very forcibly. He stopped the reader, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brothers, I wish from henceforth that this
fraternity should be called the Order of Minors."
Minor being the word in the original that expresses the
idea of "less than the least." And this was the name
they bore for many a year. It was an expressive and
suitable one. Less than the least of all the brethren&mdash;that
was what they desired to be. They were essentially of the
people, they wore the garb of the poorest, and shared their
life with its toils and privations.</p>

<p>There was also another reason for this name, some historians
say. Just before Francis formed his Order, there was
an Order of Friars established in Italy, who spent their
time in working among the poor. "Little Brothers of the
Poor," they called themselves, and it was in contradistinction
to them that Francis called himself "Minor," or
less than the "Little Brothers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of Clara.</span></h3>

<div class="poem3"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So faith grew.... The acknowledgment of God in Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Accepted by thy reason solves for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All questions in the world and out of it."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>One of the most interested listeners in the Cathedral,
the day that Francis preached his first sermon there, was
a little girl of sixteen. Her name was Clara Scifi, and
she was of noble family. From her childhood she had
been accustomed to hear discussed among the elders the
follies and madness of Francis Bernardone. Clara had
always been a good child, and from babyhood delighted to
distribute food and alms of all kinds to the poor. When
she was old enough to understand all Francis' principles,
she was greatly drawn to them, though she kept her
feelings to herself. A cousin of hers became a friar, and
this naturally intensified her interest in the Friars Minor.
But when she went to the Cathedral, and, for the first
time saw and heard Francis for herself, it was like a
revelation straight from God.</p>

<p>It seemed to Clara that he spoke directly to her, and
that he knew all her secret sorrows, and personal anxieties!
Oh how she longed to have some part in his great work! In
those days such a thing as a girl leaving her home for any
reason except to be married or immured in a convent, and
never seen, was unheard of, and when Clara made up her
mind that she would break away from her idle luxurious life
and become a servant of the poor, she knew that she was going
to do an unheard-of thing, and that never while the world
stood, would she get permission from her father, Favorina,
for any such undertaking! Clare's mother, Ortolana, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
a pious woman, but even if she were to give her consent,
it was quite certain her husband would not. Therefore
Clara determined not to tell her mother what she was
thinking about doing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Clara's Decision.</i></div>

<p>During the year that ensued after that preaching in the
Cathedral, Clara saw a great deal of Francis, and the
more she saw of him, and heard him talk, the surer she
became that God was calling her to leave home and friends.
So one March night, accompanied by two servants, Clara
left her beautiful home, and set off for the Portiuncula,
where Francis and the brothers were waiting to receive
her, and welcome her as a sister in the Lord. Singing
hymns, they led her into the little church, and after a short
service, during which they read her the Rules, her beautiful
long hair was cut off, and she robed herself in a garment
of coarse, ash-colored stuff, tied in at the waist with a rope.
After this she was conducted to a convent, some two miles
away, where the Benedictine nuns gave her a temporary
shelter.</p>

<p>Francis was too simple and unworldly to think of the
possible consequences of this step of Clara's. He was sure
that God had called her, and he was equally sure that her
friends would never give their consent to her leaving home
and becoming an apostle of poverty; therefore, as God had
revealed His will, it must be done at once. It also never
occurred to him that this was likely to develop into a
second Order of his Brotherhood, and an extension of his
work. He only saw a soul anxious to leave the world and
all that pertained to it, for Christ's sake, and his only
thought was to provide it a way of escape, just as he would
have cared for a sparrow escaping from the hawk, or a
rabbit from the snare.</p>

<p>Next day Clara's irate parents arrived at the convent.
They saw Clara, and begged and entreated, and threatened,
but all to no purpose. She would not come away. She
was absolutely unmovable. At last, seeing that she was
so determined, they gave up any idea of carrying her away
by main force, and listened to her while she talked to
them, and explained her position that she was consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to the living God, and that nothing should come between
Him and her. Her parents struck by her words consented
to leave her, and went away promising not to trouble her
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Agnes.</i></div>

<p>But the troubles of the house of Scifi were not yet over.
A fortnight later, Agnes, a child of fourteen, ran away to
join her sister. Agnes had always been intensely devoted
to Clara, and besides, she too had been longing for some
more satisfactory mode of life. It cannot be said that
Clara was surprised when Agnes knocked at the door, for
ever since her consecration she had prayed that Agnes'
heart might be touched too, and that she might be led to
follow her out of the world. Therefore she received Agnes
with open arms.</p>

<p>"Ah, sweet sister," she cried, "how I bless God that
He has so quickly heard my earnest prayer for thee!"
Agnes kissed her and declared that she had come never to
leave her, and together they braced themselves for the
storm that they felt was coming. And a terrible storm it
was! Favorina enraged at losing another daughter, took
twelve men relatives and proceeded without delay to fetch
her home by main force if necessary. However, they
smothered their rage at first, as best they could, and said
quietly to Agnes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why have you come here? Get ready and come
home."</p>

<p>Then, when she refused to leave Clara, one of them fell
on her with kicks and blows, and taking her by the hair
tried to drag her away.</p>

<p>"Ah, my sister," she cried to Clara, "come and help
me; let me not be torn away from my Lord."</p>

<p>Poor Clara could do nothing but follow her weeping. At
last, worn out with her struggles&mdash;or, as the legend says,
she became so abnormally heavy&mdash;they were obliged to drop
her. Clara, reproaching them for their cruel treatment,
begged of them to give the child back to her. Not
knowing what else to do they returned, much disappointed
at their failure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The "Poor Ladies."</i></div>

<p>This action of Clara and Agnes opened the way for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
who were hovering on the brink. As soon as they were
established at St. Damian's, which the Bishop of Assisi
placed at their disposal&mdash;they were joined by one woman
after another, many their own personal friends, and thus
the second Order of what was then called "Poor Ladies,"
was founded. The rule that they followed was very much
like that of the brothers, except in regard to the missionary
life. Women in those days never preached! The "Poor
Ladies" supplied the passive side of the organisation, and
by their prayers and supplications, supported the active
workers. Their daily needs were met by what we should
call lay-sisters, women for whom a life apart from the
world was impossible. At first the people of Assisi
brought the ladies the food they needed, but when a
little later this first ardour cooled down, the lay-sisters
took it upon themselves to provide regularly for their
necessities.</p>

<p>However, the Sisters themselves were by no means idle.
They spun thread, and made linen altar-cloths, and all
that was needed for churches round about. Then Francis
was always sending the sick and ailing to St. Damian's
to be nursed, and for some time it was quite a hospital.
Clara, who was eventually put in charge of St. Damian's
was as rigid as Francis in her conviction as to the advisability
of possessing nothing. When her father died, she
was his heir. It was a very rich inheritance she came in
for, but she commanded that everything should be sold,
and the proceeds given to the poor, and not a penny of it
went to enrich the convent. After her father's death
Clara had the joy of welcoming her mother and younger
sister Beatrice into her family!</p>

<p>Clara was always a true Franciscan. All through her
life which was a long one, she kept faithful to the principles
of the Order, and never would she yield to any dispensation
that deviated from the narrow path that Francis trod.
When offered certain properties by a Church dignitary, on
the plea that the state of the times made it impossible for
women to possess nothing, she gazed upon him with
speechless astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it is your vows that prevent you," the worthy man
went on, "you will be released from them."</p>

<p>"No," she cried, "I want no release from following
Christ."</p>

<p>She was a staunch defender of Francis. She also
defended him from himself! Many a time in hours of
dark discouragement, when he was sorely tempted to fly
away, and shut himself up to a life of prayer and contemplation,
she pointed out to him the sheep who, without a
shepherd, were wandering to their own destruction, and
drew him back again into his God-marked path. Her
teaching, and her mode of caring for her sisters was very
similar to that of Francis with his disciples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Chapter.</span></h3>

<div class="poem00"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No rushing sound we heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We saw no fiery token,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only our hearts were stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For God had spoken."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The temptation to seek a life of quiet and retirement
followed Francis all his days. Invariably, after any new
departure or special victory he was attacked in that quarter.
Why he should have been so troubled when his call to
follow Christ was so clear, we are not qualified to say
definitely. In all probability this temptation of his was
akin to Paul's "messenger of Satan" and thorn in the
flesh that buffeted him, lest he should be unduly exalted.
The most interesting point to us nineteenth-century
Christians is, that by the grace of God Francis never
yielded to this temptation&mdash;that having once put his hand
the plough, he never turned back, but remained faithful
to the end.</p>

<p>We must take into consideration that the Order of which
Francis was the founder was in itself unique. It stood
alone in the annals of Church history. It was a novelty
in the Church. All other existing orders followed a totally
different line of action, or rather inaction. Their disciples
were shut up in solitude, and devoted themselves to their
own sanctification. When they worked for sinners it was
by praying for them, by example, and by a little preaching.
They never came face to face with the outside world.
Their lives were remote, apart. These facts may have
had something to do with Francis' periods of darkness
and indecision. A pioneer's life has its own peculiar
temptations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Darkness.</i></div>

<p>Perhaps the worst season of darkness that Francis had
was after the establishment of the second Order. An
internal agony seized him. Was he, he asked himself,
not trying to do something superhuman in uniting a contemplative
with an active life. So often he had been told
by people much wiser and cleverer than himself that the
life he had marked out was humanly impossible! He
wrestled and prayed, but nothing could dissipate the heavy
blackness that spread itself over his pathway. He
determined to appeal to his brethren and follow their
advice. His appeal for help gives us a striking instance
of how subtly Satan can take the form of an Angel of
Light.</p>

<p>"My brethren what do you advise me?" he asked.
"Which do you consider best&mdash;that I should attend to
prayer, or that I should go and preach? I am a simple
man, that speaks without art. I have received the gift of
prayer more than of speaking. Besides, there is more
profit in prayer. It is the source of grace. In preaching,
we only distribute to others the gifts we have received.
Prayer purifies the heart and affections. It is the union
with the one true and solid Good. Preaching makes the
feet of even the spiritual man dusty. It is a work that
distracts and dissipates, and leads to relaxation of discipline.
In short, in prayer we speak to God, and listen to Him.
In preaching we must use much condescension towards
men, and living among them it is often necessary
to see, hear, think, and speak like them in too human
fashion. These are very serious objections. And yet
there is a reason that seems to give it most weight with
God. It is that His only Son left the bosom of the
Father to save souls, and to instruct men by His example
and word. He gave all He had for our salvation. He kept
nothing for Himself. Therefore it seems to me more in
conformity with the Divine Will that I renounce a tranquil
life and that I go to work abroad. But what is your
advice? Speak! What do you think I ought to do?"</p>

<p>The respective merits of the question had been so equally
weighed that it is not surprising that the brethren, one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
all, declared themselves unable to give any advice. For
several days they conferred, but no clear light shone upon
their conferences. It was an important matter to decide,
because the whole future conduct of the Order hung upon
the decision. As Francis would walk, so also would tread
his disciples. This fact, together with the general uncertainty,
pressed heavily upon his soul. One of the
most spiritual of Francis' historians says that God
permitted him to pass through this darkness, because He
wanted His servant whom He had already made a prophet,
to learn by a striking example, that no inspiration comes
to us from ourselves. And more than this. He wished
the merit and glory of preaching to be consecrated by a
species of oracle that could only be attributed to Him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How the Answer Came.</i></div>

<p>This is how the answer came.</p>

<p>Francis, always little in his own eyes, was never
ashamed of inquiring of any one, the simple as well as
the learned, the imperfect as well as the perfect, if
he thought that by so doing he would be the better
able to extend the Kingdom. In the present instance,
getting no light from the brethren, he sent a message
to Brother Sylvester, who was now a very old man,
and lived by himself on a mountain, and another to
Clara, asking them to pray that God would reveal to them
his will. The old priest, and the young girl and her
companions, gave themselves up to prayer, and God who
declares that He will be inquired of, revealed to them His
will.</p>

<p>When the messages came, as they did together, Francis
was on his knees praying. Both messengers carried the
same message. It was God's will, they said, that he
should leave his solitude, and preach the Gospel.</p>

<p>Immediately, without losing a moment, Francis got up,
put on his mantle, and set of. All his doubt had vanished
at once.</p>

<p>"Let us go, my brethren," he said. "Let us go in the
name of the Lord!"</p>

<p>It seemed as if he were possessed by a new spirit.
Never had he been so fervent. Never had his ardor been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
so intense. To all that he did God set His seal in a truly
marvellous manner! The inhabitants of the various
villages flocked to hear him, and they almost stood upon
one another to find places in the churches and cathedrals.
In those days the cathedrals and great churches were not
seated. The people stood all the time. The men to the
front, and the women very often far behind. When there
was a large crowd, the crush was fearful.</p>

<p>In Ascoli some thirty men from the Church joined the
Minors, and were given the habit. After this event,
Francis could not show himself in the street without being
surrounded by a crowd. When once he came into a town
the population had no thought for any one but him. The
churches were filled as soon as ever it was known he was
going to speak. Even in the streets they eagerly gathered
up his words. Thus it was everywhere he went through
Central Italy. His name was in everyone's mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Great Tree.</i></div>

<p>It was some time now since the building at the
Portiuncula had become far too small to accommodate all
who wished to join the Friars. There had been nothing
for it but to overflow into the neighbouring provinces. It
is a matter of some regret that but little of the history
of this extension has been preserved. We shall see how
Bernardo of Quintavelle, and Guido of Cortona, established
branches of the Order, and no doubt the story of other
new ventures would have been equally interesting, but all
that history has handed down to us is a list of names. The
tiny seed that Francis had sown in weakness was rapidly
becoming a great tree. Though this progress was gratifying
to him, it also caused him some suffering. By
nature he was intensely affectionate, and when one by one
he had to send out from him his old companions to take
charge of distant branches, his heart was sad indeed.</p>

<p>One day while he was thinking, as he often did, about
his absent friends, the thought occurred to him that
something might be done to alleviate this separation.
Something, too, that would benefit the entire Order.
Twice a year it was arranged that all the brethren, new
and old, should meet at the Portiuncula. This idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
proved to be so good that it became one of the fundamental
rules of the Order.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Curious Scene.</i></div>

<p>The first of these "Chapters," as they were called, was
held after Francis had completed his tour in Central Italy.
The brethren came from far and near. They came pouring
in from all quarters, up from the valleys, and down from
the mountains, and from the shining sea-coast, streams
of brown-robed, bare-footed men of all classes and conditions
of life. And what were they coming to? A little church
and convent as poor as themselves, where there were not
even provisions enough on hand to supply one-hundredth
part of the hundreds that were flocking there with one meal!
But in perfect faith and trust they came, plodding along
under the blazing sun, some rapt in meditation, others
saluting all they met with their gentle salutation, "the
peace of God."</p>

<p>Such a sight was never seen in Italy before, and from
castle and city poured glittering vividly-colored groups to
see the wonderful sight. The richly-colored garments of
the crowd, and the gaily-decked cavalcade from the country
and castle formed a brilliant foil to the brown-robed stream
of friars. The Portiuncula is situated on one of the lowest
slopes of the Appenine hills, below it stretches the wide
plain. This was the guest-chamber. There were no other
beds than the bare ground, with here and there a little straw.
But we need not pity them as far as sleeping out of doors
goes, because the Umbrian nights are of all things most
beautiful. The air was soft and warm, and the brilliant
blue-starred heavens above did away with any need of
artificial light.</p>

<p>Francis met this crowd with great pleasure and cheerfulness,
though he had not a crust to offer them. When they
were all assembled he told them with sublime faith to
give no thought as to what they were to eat or drink, but
only to praise God. And his faith was rewarded. The
people came from Perugia, Spoleto, Foligno, and Assisi,
and from all the neighboring country to carry meat and
drink to that strange congregation. They came with
horses and asses, and carts laden with bread and cheese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and beans and other good things, and besides this they
brought plates, and jugs, and knives; and knights, and
barons, and other noblemen, who had come to look on,
waited on the brothers with much devotion. It was such
sight as once seen could never be forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Three Grades.</i></div>

<p>In these chapters Francis was at his best, and happily
the historians of the time have preserved for us details
of his mode of work. He was there to spend and be
spent. His one desire was that the brethren should gain
a renewal of spiritual strength in the days passed together,
and at the same time that the Order in general should
be benefited. To attain the first end, he employed what
we have pointed out before as being one of his strongest
points&mdash;private and individual dealing. As we have also
already intimated, we feel sure that the greater part of his
phenomenal success resulted from this. In his own mind
he had the brethren carefully graded. There were three
divisions. First, the fervent; second, the troubled in
spirit; and thirdly, the tepid. The correctness with which
he assigned everyone to his proper place was well-nigh
divine. At the time of writing the fervent were numerous,
but they were likely to be carried away by an exaggerated
zeal. Some of them wore chains, and were ruining their
health with over-watchings and fastings. Francis boldly
forbade this. He would have none of it. He spoke to
such kindly and tenderly, but he also spoke forcibly in
commending that reason which must regulate piety, as it
regulates human life. By precise and detailed rules he
delivered the fervent from exhausting their strength before
its time, and thus preserved them for their work. But it
was not an easy task that of controlling the fervent,
especially when there was a spice of self-will in addition
to the fervency.</p>

<p>In a large community, such as Francis now had on
his hands, there is always sure to be a large percentage
of troubled ones. Francis well knew this, he
knew that the devil was always on the alert, that trials
without and within are the lot of every mortal. These
troubled ones found in their leader a tower of strength. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
him they poured out their most secret confidences. The
difficulties they had with uncongenial brethren, their
interior doubts and fears, and awful dread that such
might one day cause them to fall away. Francis showed
all such the sincerest compassion. They knew and felt
or that he loved them. His sympathy was a remedy
in itself. They left him cheered and refreshed and
strengthened.</p>

<p>Human weakness is never slow in showing itself, and
the tepid were easily recognized. They were generally
those who had made a very good beginning, but had
allowed their zeal to cool and were becoming unfaithful to
the grace God had given them, and to the rules of the
Order. Francis was always gentle to these as he
was gentle to all, but he knew how to maintain his
authority&mdash;to reprove, blame, and correct. He followed the
Divine recommendation, "If thy brother shall offend thee,
go and rebuke him between thee and him alone." His
happiness was complete if he could gain the tepid brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Duty of Humility.</i></div>

<p>In the general meetings where all the brethren were
assembled he dealt with the interests of the whole work.
He was very strong at these times on the duty of humility.</p>

<p>"Make yourselves small and humble to everyone," he
would say, "but above all, be humble to the priests. The
care of souls has been entrusted to them. We are only
auxiliaries, to do what they cannot do." They were never
to enter any field of labor without the invitation, or at least
the consent, of the local clergy. And then, when they had
received this permission they must never act as though
they were masters. This policy acted well. The local
clergy had no misgivings in seeking their assistance. They
knew that these men would not try to make the people
discontented with their own pastors, but rather sow
content.</p>

<p>Another spirit Francis strove to get into his followers&mdash;that
was the spirit of tolerance. He warned them against
carrying their attitude, in regard to riches, to excess, and
to say that all men must see as they did or remain unsaved.
Other reformers had done this and were extinguished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
The rule of poverty was God's leading for Francis. All
men he recognized were not called to follow this track,
though some of his disciples, in their enthusiasm, would
have it that they were. To them Francis said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not use the sacrifices you impose upon yourselves
as a weapon. Beware of haughty reproofs. We must
show the same mercy that has been shown to us. The
God Who has called us may also call them by-and-bye. I
wish all that are here never to call the rich anything but
brothers and lords. They are our brothers, since they
have the same Creator as we, and they are our lords also
because without them we could not persevere in the
poverty that we have made our law."</p>

<p>This spirit of tolerance was to extend to the sinners.
He did not like to hear them berated.</p>

<p>"Many who are the children of the devil to-day," he
said, "will become true disciples. Perhaps they will go
before us. This thought alone ought to keep us from all
violence of language. We have been sent to bring back
to the truth those who are ignorant and in error. That
is our office, and one that is not accomplished by the use
of cutting words and sharp reproaches.... It is not
enough that our compassion be in words only. The important
thing is that it should be in our deeds, that all
who see us may, by occasion of us, praise our common
Father, Who is in Heaven."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Holiness.</i></div>

<p>He was also strong on holiness. He taught that there
must be a true light within that shines only from a clean
heart, before it can shine on the outer world, and without
this no good work could be accomplished. Francis was
full of the grace and wisdom of Jesus Christ. Of the
spiritual effect of the first chapter a historian writes&mdash;</p>

<p>"The brethren valued the gift they had received. Not
one of them cared to talk of profane matters. They talked
about the holy examples given by some amongst them, and
sought together ways of growing in grace and in the knowledge
of Jesus Christ."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some of Francis' Converts.</span></h3>

<div class="poem01"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, the people needed helping&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Needed love&mdash;(for love and Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the only gifts not bartered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They alone are freely given)."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>It is rather a pity that there have not been more
detailed accounts handed down to us of the converts who
could point to Francis as their spiritual father. It would
have given us yet another side of that life which was the
most glorious spiritual light of the dark age in which he
lived! From the few that we meet incidentally, here and
there, we have no doubt that such documents, were they
forthcoming, would be of immense value. But, alas, the
age in which Francis lived was not an essentially literary
one, and writing was one of the accomplishments left to
the few! So we must therefore make the best of such
scanty material as we have at our disposal, and try to give
you an idea of the different species of humanity that were
attracted by the kindly, gracious, Christ-like personality of
Francis.</p>

<p>We have seen how at first, he had no idea of his call
extending any further than himself and his own life and
conduct. Then one by one, at first, and more quickly
afterwards, men ranged themselves under his standard,
and claimed him as their leader. Naturally, and simply,
he took up his new position, and the duties attached
thereto. He seemed to know by intuition those whom
God had singled out to be his followers, and one after
another heard Francis, as the voice of God calling them to
leave all and follow the lowly despised Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Soldiers in the Christian Army.</i></div>

<p>One of the first of these was a laborer named John.</p>

<p>It was always a great grief to Francis when he saw a
church left dirty and neglected. It gave him positive pain
to think that anyone could neglect the House of God, and
give it less care than they would their own homes. When
he went on different preaching tours he used to call the
priests of the locality together, and beg of them to look
after the decency of the churches. He was not content
merely to preach, but often he bound stalks of heather
together and made himself a broom, and set to work and
showed them an example.</p>

<p>One day he was busily engaged in sweeping out a church
when a peasant appeared. He had left his cart and come
to see what was going on. After he had stared for a time,
he went over to Francis and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, let me have the broom and I will help you."
He took the broom, and finished the church.</p>

<p>When his task was ended, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, for a long time, ever since I heard men speak
of you, I have decided to serve God. I never knew where
to find you. Now it has pleased God that we should meet,
and henceforth I will do whatever you command me."</p>

<p>Francis was convinced that he would make a good friar,
so he accepted him. This John was renowned afterwards
for his piety, the other friars admired him greatly. He
did not live very long, and after his death, Francis used to
love to tell the story of his conversion, always speaking of
him as Brother <i>Saint</i> John.</p>

<p>Angelo Tancredi was a young knight, rich, and of noble
family. Francis met him one day in the neighbourhood of
Rieti. He had never seen him before, he knew nothing
whatever of him, but inspired by God, he went up to him
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brother, thou hast long worn belt, sword and
spurs. Henceforth thy belt must be a rope, thy sword the
Cross of Jesus Christ, and for spurs thou must have dust
and mud. Follow me. I will make thee a soldier in the
Christian Army."</p>

<p>Angelo's heart must have been prepared by God for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
this call, because we read that "the brave soldier
immediately followed Francis as the Apostles followed
our Lord."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>New Recruits.</i></div>

<p>Those who lived with him say that he was distinguished
by a "glorious simplicity," meaning, no doubt,
that while he accepted the humility of his new life, he
retained something of his distinguished manners, and
chivalrous bearing. He was a personal friend of Francis',
and one to whom he could always unburden his soul.</p>

<p>Guido of Cortono is said to have been a born Franciscan.
Passing through Cortono, on a preaching tour, Francis
found him ready, and almost waiting for him. He was a
young man of singular purity of character. He had neither
father nor mother, and lived quietly on the means they
had left him. What was over from his income, he gave to
the poor. After he had heard Francis preach, he went
up to him and begged that he would come to his house,
and make it his home as long as he stayed in Cortono.
Francis consented, and as he and his companion followed
Guido home, Francis said&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the grace of God this young man will be one of
us, and will sanctify himself among his fellow-citizens."</p>

<p>After they had eaten and rested, Guido offered himself
to Francis to be one of his disciples. Francis agreed to
receive him upon condition that he should sell all his goods.
This was done, apparently on the spot, for we read that
the three went round the town, distributing the money.
After this Francis conducted Guido into the Church, and
there clothed him with the "beast" colored robe.</p>

<p>Guido retired to a place outside the city, and became
the founder of a branch of the work. A small monastery
was built, and such of his converts in the locality, as
were called to be friars, Guido received.</p>

<p>Sometimes the very talk about what Francis was doing,
was used of God to re-kindle the flame of love to Him in
hearts where it had nearly been extinguished. Simply
hearing of the crowds that were seeking forgiveness of sins,
roused others to a sense of their eternal needs. Amongst
this number was John Parenti.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Parenti was a magistrate, a clever, thinking man, who
lived in the neighbourhood of Florence. He had long
been very careless about his soul, and what little religion
he ever had had was fast slipping out of his careless hold.
He had heard of Francis, and the reformation that was
taking place in Umbria, and meditated long and deeply on
all that he heard, wondering, no doubt, if there was really
"anything in it," or was it not "all mere excitement."
Still, he was more than ever convinced that he himself had
very little religion to boast of.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Swineherd and his Pigs.</i></div>

<p>One evening he was taking a walk in the country when
he met a swine-herd. This youth was in great difficulty
over his contrary flock. As is the nature of pigs, mediæval
or otherwise, they went in every direction except that in
which they were wanted to go! Parenti stood looking on
amused at the boy's efforts. With much labor at last he
got them towards the stable door, and as they were rushing
in he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go in, you beasts, go in as the magistrates and judges
go into hell!"</p>

<p>It was only the uncouth speech of an equally uncouth
swine-herd, but God used it to the salvation of his soul.
He began to think about the dangers of his profession,
and the state in which he was living, and where he should
really go to if he died. The business of salvation looked to
him that evening as the only one worth taking up, and the
straight and narrow road the only safe place.</p>

<p>He went home and confided all his hopes and fears to
his son. Together they decided that they would go and
find Francis, and tell him they wanted to change their
life. They saw Francis, and before they left him, they
had made up their minds to become friars. They came
back, sold all their goods, and then put on the garment of
the Order. Parenti was a valuable acquisition to the
Order, and rose to considerable eminence in after days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Prince of Poets.</i></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the most remarkable of Francis' converts
was Pacificus, as he was known in the Order. This
man was a noted poet and musician. He was known
throughout Italy as "The King of the Verses," and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
considered to be the very prince of poets. He excelled in
songs, and was greatly appreciated everywhere. His supremacy
was so undoubted that several times he had received the
poet's crown from the hands of the Emperor of Germany,
that very same crown that afterwards adorned the brows
of Petrarch and Tasso. He was visiting at San Severino
when he met Francis.</p>

<p>A house of "Poor Ladies" had just been founded in
this place, and Francis was preaching in their chapel.
Some friends of Pacificus had relatives among the "Poor
Ladies," and as they were going to visit them they asked
him to come along too. He went, and as Francis was
preaching they stopped to hear him. The tone, and the
eloquence of the preacher, arrested Pacificus, and he could
not hide his emotion as one truth after another struck his
conscience. Francis perceiving that one hearer at least
was touched by his words, turned the point of his discourse
straight at him. The longer Pacificus listened, the more
he was convinced not only that the hand of the Lord was
upon him, but that a great work was required of him. As
soon as the sermon was over, he asked to speak with
Francis. That conversation completely won Pacificus.
Francis spoke to him of the judgments of God, and the
vanities of the world.</p>

<p>"Enough of words," cried the Poet, "let us have
deeds! Withdraw me, I pray you, from men, and restore
me to the supreme Emperor."</p>

<p>Francis was always a lover of decision, and the next day
he gave him the habit, and took him on to Assisi with him.
Ever after this the poet was known as Pacificus, in memory
of the peace of Christ that that day flowed into his soul.
His life was beautiful in its simplicity. His historian
writes, "he seemed rather to forget what he had been,
than have to make any violent effort to force himself to a
new life." In other words, his life "was hid with Christ
in God."</p>

<p>This conversion of Pacificus attracted a great deal of
attention and did much towards advertising the Franciscans
all over Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Professor Pepoli.</i></div>

<p>Professor Pepoli filled an important chair in the Bologna
University. He was converted through the preaching of
Francis in Bologna. Of this preaching an eye witness
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, Thomas, Archdeacon of the Cathedral Church,
studying at Bologna, saw Francis preach in the square,
where nearly the whole town was assembled. He spoke
first of angels, and men, and devils. He explained the
spiritual natures with such exactitude and eloquence that
his hearers were astonished that such words could come from
the mouth of so simple a man. Nor did he follow the
usual course of preachers. His discourse resembles rather
those harangues that are made by popular orators. At the
conclusion he spake only of the extinction of hatred, and
the urgency of concluding treaties of peace and compacts
of union. His garment was soiled and torn, his person
mean, his face pale, but God gave his words unheard of
power. He even converted noblemen, whose unrestrained
fury had bathed the country in blood, and many of them
were reconciled."</p>

<p>Professor Pepoli came under the spell of this preaching.
A little later all Bologna was electrified by hearing that he
was about to give up his professorship and become one of
Francis' disciples. His friends did all in their power to
keep him. They pointed out to him how much he loved
his studies and the glory that was his. All in vain. Professor
Pepoli had already been accepted by Francis.</p>

<p>Three years later he died, greatly mourned by an entire
monastery of which he had been the founder.</p>

<p>If there were one class of men that Francis took more
interest in than another, after the lepers, it was the thieves
and robbers that abounded all over Europe. One day a
number of them came begging at the monastery. Angelo
Tancredi opened the door to them and, true to his soldierly
instincts, was very wroth at their impudence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Robbers.</i></div>

<p>"What!" he cried, "Robbers, evil-doers, assassins,
have you no shame for stealing the goods of others, but
would you devour the goods of the servants of God? You
who are not worthy to live, and respect neither men or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
God. Get you hence, and never let me see you here
again!"</p>

<p>The robbers departed, full of rage. Francis next
appeared close on their heels, carrying with him some
bread and wine that had been given to him. Angelo told
him of the impudence of the robbers, and how he had
served them. To his surprise, Francis was much grieved
at his conduct, and reproved him for his cruelty.</p>

<p>"Go at once," he said, "and take this bread and wine
and seek those robbers till you have found them, and
offer them this bread from me, then ask their pardon,
and pray them in my name to no longer do wrong, but fear
God."</p>

<p>Angelo departed, while Francis stayed at home and
prayed for the success of his undertaking. The robbers
were found, and Angelo brought them back to the monastery
where they not only sought the pardon of their sins, but
became friars, and lived and died in true holiness.</p>

<p>One day Francis and some of the friars were passing
round the foot of a great castle. It was evident there was
some festival going on inside! The banner of the house
floated over the gates, and the sound of trumpets were
heard half over the country-side. The young Count of
Montefeltro was about to be knighted.</p>

<p>"Come," said Francis, suddenly inspired, "let us go
to the Castle, and with God's help perhaps we may make
some spiritual knight."</p>

<p>As soon as the ceremony was ended, and the company
began to pour out into the courtyard, Francis stood up on
a low wall and began to preach. He spoke of the worthlessness
of all earthly pleasures compared to the heavenly
ones. He showed what the love of God could do in the
human soul, pointing them to the apostles and martyrs as
illustration, and contrasting the chivalry of the Christian
heroes with that which was human glory only. It was an
appropriate subject, and the people listened attentively.</p>

<p>Amongst the audience was a valiant knight, Count
Orlando, Lord of Chiusi. Immediately after the sermon,
he went to Francis and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should like to talk to you about the salvation of my
soul."</p>

<p>"Most willingly," replied Francis, always courteous,
"but this is not quite a fitting moment. You must honor
those who have invited you. First go and dine with them,
and after the repast we will converse at leisure."</p>

<p>Count Orlando did so, and returning to Francis they
talked together. Very soon Orlando was happier than he
had ever been in his life before, because he knew that his
sins were all pardoned. Before he parted with Francis he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have in my domains a mountain called La Vernia.
It is exactly suited to men who wish to live in solitude.
If it please thee I will give it to thee most willingly."</p>

<p>Francis accepted the offer, and the mountain was used
as a place where the brethren could go to pray, and rest
when worn out with the fatigue of their work. It was
really a huge plateau on top of a steep mountain, covered
with trees. Amongst these, some little cells were constructed,
and a quieter, more restful place it would be hard
to imagine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Peasant's Advice.</i></div>

<p>It was when Francis was climbing this mountain
once, that a peasant, who took him up on his ass, asked
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you the Francis of Assisi that is so much talked
of?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Francis, "I am."</p>

<p>"Well," responded the man, "You will have hard work
to be as good as they say you are. They have such confidence
in you, it is difficult for you to be equal to it, at
least that is <i>my</i> opinion."</p>

<p>Francis was charmed with this opinion, and thanked the
man for his charitable advice, but before that journey was
ended, the peasant was convinced that Francis was as
good as "they" said he was.</p>

<p>Our readers must not imagine that Francis' converts
were all men. Far from it. Many women, besides Clara
and Agnes, had to thank God that he ever came their way
and taught them how to love and serve God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"<i>Our Brother Jacqueline!</i>"</div>

<p>There was Jacqueline. She was of noble family, and
though she did not leave the world like Clara, yet she
served the cause right nobly. She was a most unusual
woman for her times. We are told that "she was not
afraid of business!" She went in person and treated
with the Benedictines, and induced them to give up certain
buildings in favor of the Friars Minor. All her riches
and influence she put at the disposal of the Franciscans,
who had no more active patron than Jacqueline. Francis
used to call her jokingly "our brother Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>On one of the last tours Francis was able to make, he
suffered much from pain and depression. To cheer him,
says a historian, God gave him a piece of work to do for
Him. He was passing through a place called Voluisiano,
when a young lady, the wife of the baron of the place, ran
after him. When she caught up with him she was very
much out of breath. Francis looked at her with interest,
and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Madam?"</p>

<p>"I want you to bless me," she said.</p>

<p>"Are you married?" went on Francis.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the girl, "and my husband is very
stern. He sets himself against my serving Jesus Christ.
He is my great trouble. I have received a right will from
Heaven, and I cannot follow it on account of him. Will
you pray that God may soften his heart?"</p>

<p>"My daughter," Francis said in great compassion, "Go,
I am assured your husband will become your consolation.
Tell him this from God and me, 'Now is the time of
salvation, recompense will surely come.'"</p>

<p>Then he gave her his blessing.</p>

<p>The lady went home, and finding her husband, gave him
Francis' message. The Spirit of God carried it to his
inmost soul.</p>

<p>"He is right," he said to his wife, "Let us serve God
together, and save our souls in our own house!"</p>

<p>"The Lord be praised," cried his wife, and together
they thanked God for the gift of His wonderful salvation.
They lived for a great many years in godliness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
holiness, and passed away to be with Christ, the one in
the morning and the other in the evening of the same
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Catalogue of Names.</i></div>

<p>Other equally interesting incidents, we have no doubt
cluster round what, unfortunately, the historians present
to us in the form of a catalogue of mere names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter XIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Martyrs.</span></h3>

<div class="poem0"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God the Father, give us grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To walk in the light of Jesu's Face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God the Son, give us a part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hiding place of Jesu's Heart.<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>They were five in number. Their names were Berard,
Peter, Otho, Adjutorius, and Accurtius. When they first
started out for Morocco, a sixth, Vital, was with them,
but at an early stage of the journey he fell sick, and rather
than the mission should be delayed on his account he
insisted on their leaving him behind. He never recovered,
but died about the same time as his brothers were
martyred.</p>

<p>About these martyrs historians are divided in their
minds. Some say that they were foolish and extreme and
courted persecution, others declare that they were animated
by the Holy Ghost, and others that it was a part of God's
great plan for the encouraging of the Franciscan movement.
Certain it is, that in their case, the blood thus spilled was
fruitful, and brought to life rich fruit, and we have no doubt
that to-day they are among that mighty throng who are
clothed in white raiment, and bear palms in their hands,
who on earth "counted not their life dear to them." The
memory of such souls is always fragrant, and supreme
love, even though it may appear ill-regulated, is better
than a tepid affection which is unworthy the name.</p>

<p>The five travelled by way of Portugal, where they were
well received. At Seville they stopped in the house of a
Christian merchant for eight days, which time they spent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
prayer. At the end of the eight days they informed the
gentleman why they had come, and further said that they
were about to commence a little preaching in Seville.
Seville was at this period in the hands of the Moors.
The poor merchant was utterly horrified at their proposals,
he threw every obstacle in their way, telling them that
they would do no good, and only make it hard for the
Christian merchants who were allowed to trade there!
Needless to say, such worldly reasoning had no effect upon
the disciples of Francis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Preaching in at Mosque.</i></div>

<p>Their first attempt was, of all places, in a mosque!
While the Moors were engaged in devotion one day, they
were electrified to hear a loud voice proclaim to them Jesus
Crucified. They immediately rose up and drove the
intruders out with blows and curses. The five next
repaired to a larger mosque, and sought to obtain a
hearing there. Again they were thrown out. Then a
brilliant idea occurred to the leader, Berard.</p>

<p>"We will go to the King," he said. "If we gain him,
the victory over the others will be easy!"</p>

<p>In spite of all difficulties, they managed to gain
admission to the Court, and present their plea. The
King was enraged at their audacity, and ordered them to
be scourged and beheaded, which was the summary mode
in which justice was dealt out in that era. If it had not
been for the intercession of the King's son, this sentence
would have been carried into effect, as it was they were
taken away and imprisoned in a tower.</p>

<p>A few hours later all Seville gathered to see a strange
sight! There, on top of the prison tower, stood the
five, brown-robed, bare-footed strangers, singing with all
their might praises to the one true God! They were then
taken and thrust into the darkest and deepest dungeon.
But as solitary confinement was unknown then, they found
that they had a congregation all ready to listen to them,
and, as long as they stayed there, they never ceased to
preach repentance to the prisoners.</p>

<p>They were not left in prison very long. The King sent
for them again, and began by coaxing them to leave off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
preaching. He promised them riches and honor, if they
would only stop talking about Jesus Christ. They thanked
him courteously, and Berard said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would to God, noble prince, you would show mercy to
yourself! You need it more than we do. Treat us as you
will, you can, at the utmost, only deprive us of life, and
that is a matter of little moment to us who hope for
eternal joys!"</p>

<p>What to do with these strange men the King did not
know! Their courage and heroism he could not but
admire, still they were very dangerous. After a consultation
with his officers, they decided that the best thing to
be done was to get them quietly out of the country.
Accordingly they were placed in a vessel bound to Morocco.
This exile filled the five with joy! At last they were to
begin work in an infidel country!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Don Pedro.</i></div>

<p>Now, Don Pedro, the brother of King Alphonso of
Portugal, a nominal Christian, had had some kind of a
dispute with the King, in consequence of which he had
come to live in Morocco. Notwithstanding his Christianity,
he had been placed at the head of a Mussulman army.
To him the missionaries repaired. By this time their
personal appearance was anything but improved. Suffering
and imprisonment had done their work, their faces were
wan and thin, and their garments were all but in rags.
Nevertheless, Don Pedro received them kindly, and
promised to befriend them. He warned them against
being too extreme, cautioned them to moderation, and
begged that they would not expose themselves to danger.</p>

<p>But Don Pedro knew nothing about that love, which is
as fire in the bones, and is strong as death; so strong that
no barriers can keep it within bounds. The next morning
found the missionaries hard at work. They had learned
that there was going to be some kind of a public procession
through the town as the King was going to visit the tomb
of his ancestors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Prison and Torture.</i></div>

<p>A procession to the five meant people, a concourse of
sinners and infidels, a glorious opportunity, and if they
did not make the best of it, they would be unworthy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
name they bore. Just as the King was passing, Berard,
who could speak Arabic, mounted a cart and began to
preach. Instead of stopping when the royal train
passed, as a Mussulman would have done, he waxed more
vehement. To the King this seemed either insolence or
madness, and having charitably decided on madness, he
ordered the missionaries to be banished. Don Pedro, who
by this time had had enough of his troublesome guests,
gave them an escort to the nearest seaport, and hurried
their departure. Again he reckoned without his host. It
was to the Moors the five were sent to preach, and to the
Moors they were bound to go, so they escaped from their
escort, returned to Morocco, and began to preach again in
the streets.</p>

<p>This was too much for the King, and he had them thrown
into the vilest of dungeons, where for several weeks they
languished in great misery, with barely enough to eat.
One of the nobles of the Court who was secretly inclined
to the Friars, advised the King to let them out, but place
them under proper care. This was done, and they were
handed over to the unfortunate Don Pedro, who was far
from cheerful at seeing them back again. He was about
to start off on a military expedition into the interior, and
not daring to leave his awkward charge behind, he took
them with him. Nothing much is known of their doings
till they got back again to Morocco, whereupon they began
their preaching again without any more delay. Yet again
the King commanded that they should be thrown into
prison, and this time they were sentenced to torture.
Albozaida was the name of the officer who was to carry
out this sentence. In his heart he pitied and admired the
missionaries, and notwithstanding the order he had
received, he merely had them shut up, and begged of the
King to pardon them. But it was no use. The King was
very angry, and demanded that his will be carried out
without delay. So there was nothing for Albozaida to do
but to hand them over to the executioner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The End.</i></div>

<p>Alas for them! this man was a renegade Christian, and
no torture was too great for him to inflict upon them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
were dragged through the streets with cords round their
necks, they were beaten, they were rolled over pieces of
glass and broken tiles, and when evening came, vinegar
was poured into their open wounds, lest the night should
bring too much cessation from pain. But they smiled at
pain, and praised God in the midst of the greatest tortures.
This treatment failing to kill them, the King desired to see
them again. He spoke to them at first as though he had
never seen them before.</p>

<p>"Are you the impious men who despise the true faith,
the madmen who blaspheme the Prophet of the Lord?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh King," they replied, "far from despising the true
faith, we are ready to die for it. It is true that our faith
is not your faith."</p>

<p>The King did not appear to be displeased with this bold
statement. He had another argument at hand. He sent
for a number of richly-dressed women, and presenting
them to the missionaries he said, "If you will follow
the law of Mahomet, I will give you these women for
wives, and you shall have positions of honor and power
in my kingdom. If not, you shall die by the sword!"</p>

<p>"Prince," they answered, "We want neither your
women nor your honors. Be such things yours, and
Jesus Christ ours. Make us suffer all your tortures, kill
us. Pain will be light to us. We look to Heaven!"</p>

<p>Maddened by his own insufficiency the King got up,
seized a sword, and cleft their heads as though he were
but a common executioner. Thus perished the first
Franciscan Martyrs.</p>

<p>And did they accomplish nothing? Was their mission
an utter failure, as some historians write it? Let us see
for ourselves.</p>

<p>As soon as the missionaries had been killed, the mob
took their bodies, and dragged them in the mire, and horribly
mutilated them. However, Don Pedro, who up till now
had been but a very poor representative of the Church of
Christ, was deeply touched by the death of the five, and
his once half-sleeping conscience was awakened into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
activity. He got possession of the battered bodies, and
resolving that he would have nothing further to do with
the enemies of Christianity, took them, and went back to
his own country. As soon as he arrived at Coimbra, King
Alphonse came out to meet him, and with great rejoicing
the remains of the Missionary Martyrs were carried to
the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fernandez.</i></div>

<p>Amongst those who followed in the train of the king was
a young man some twenty-five years old, of noble family,
named Fernandez. This young man was tremendously
stirred by the story of the martyred five. Their life and
death spoke to his soul as nothing had ever done before,
he longed to follow in their steps. He had a great deal of
conversation with certain Franciscans who lived in a settlement
hut outside the town. They came sometimes and
begged at his door, and he used to question them.</p>

<p>One day he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I became one of you, would you send me to the
country of the Saracens, that like your holy martyrs I
might shed my blood for the faith?"</p>

<p>They replied, saying, it was the wish of Francis that
his people should go and preach to the infidels.</p>

<p>"If that is so," said Fernandez, "bring me the habit of
your Order and let me put it on."</p>

<p>Without any pomp or ceremony Fernandez put on the
coarse robe, changed his name to that of Anthony, and,
bidding good-bye to his family, joined the Franciscans. To
go into all the details of his story would take too much
space, but Fernandez became one of the shining lights of
the Franciscan movement, and many rose up to call him
blessed!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Father of Souls.</i></div>

<p>He went to Africa, but it was not God's will that he
should labor there. A violent fever reduced him to such a
degree of weakness that he had to leave the country. He
set sail, meaning to return to his native land and get
restored in body, but a storm drove the vessel on to the
coast of Italy. He preached there for a time and then
went on to the Portiuncula, where Francis was presiding
over a gathering of the brethren. There God showed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that Africa and a martyr's crown were not for him, and
cheerfully accepting the work that God meant for him, he
became the father of thousands of souls.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">First Foreign Missions.</span></h3>

<div class="poem4"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They are gone where Love is frozen, and Faith grown calm and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the world is all triumphant, and the sheep have left the fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where His children scorn His blessings, and His sacred shrine despise."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>It was about the time of the first chapter that Francis
began to feel drawn to foreign fields. The Franciscans
had now spread all over Italy, and there was a general
desire shown by the brethren to extend their ministrations
outside that country. It would appear that at its close, a
small number of the brethren were sent out to evangelize
the various countries of Europe, Portugal, Hungary,
Germany, etc.</p>

<p>For himself Francis had a larger and more daring
scheme.</p>

<p>It was the time of the Crusades. All Christian Europe
was bending its energies to wrest the tomb of our Saviour
out of the hands of the Saracens. Band after band of
Crusaders had marched into the Sultan's territory&mdash;to
suffer defeat and death. Francis was too much of a
soldier and knight not be stirred by the tales of bravery and
daring which were rife everywhere. But he had his own
opinions.</p>

<p>"Is there not," he asked himself, "a more beautiful
way of gaining the desired end? Why all this bloodshed?
why this wholesale hurrying of men to perdition?
why all this strife between the children of one Father?
Why has no one ever tried to gain these infidels over on
Christ's side? How many lives might be spared, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
what an increase there would be for His Church if they
succeeded!"</p>

<p>It was a noble thought, and one worthy of Francis.
The more he pondered these matters the more convinced
he became that it was his duty to put his ideas into practice.
He told some of the brethren his purpose, and they, convinced
that God led him, made no objection, and in a very
short time he was ready to begin his difficult and dangerous
undertaking. Peter of Cantani was appointed to take the
government of the Order during his absence.</p>

<p>Francis, and his companion, whose name we are not
told, embarked at Ancona. How they got their passage
without any money we do not know, but it is evident that
they managed it somehow. When they were well out to
sea, such a storm arose as caused them to seek refuge on
the coast of Illyria. It was supposed at first that the delay
would only be one of a few weeks, but the stormy weather
persistently continuing, it soon became evident that it
would be impossible to cross the Levant at that season of
the year. This was a great disappointment to Francis, but
he was far from being discouraged. He determined to
return to Ancona. A vessel was about to sail, and he
presented himself as a passenger, but as he had no money
they refused to take him on board.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Dilemma!</i></div>

<p>Here was a dilemma! But help was at hand. One of
the ship's officers, a good man, was touched by the harshness
with which the missionaries were treated, so he went
to Francis and told him that he would take them on board.
He conducted them down into the hold, and hid them
behind some horses there. Hardly had they been deposited
when an unknown friend brought an enormous basket of
provisions, and, giving it to their benefactor, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take this, take great care of it, and as the need arises,
distribute it to the poor brethren you have hidden."</p>

<p>The need soon arose. Another fearful storm beat the
vessel about to such an extent that the voyage was prolonged
far beyond the usual limit. Provisions were
exhausted and a famine threatened the unhappy crew.
Then Francis, hearing of the distress, crept out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
among the horses, explained his presence, and said that he
had food which he would be glad to share with them. The
legend tells us that the food was miraculously made to
last the voyage; the real fact was probably that the
basket contained large supplies of beans, and lentils, and
macaroni, and such Italian foods that swell in the cooking,
and go a long way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>In Spain.</i></div>

<p>Arriving at Ancona, Francis began to preach. He had
a wonderful time, and a great number of clerics and laymen
joined the Order. Part of them Francis took with
him to the Portiuncula, and offered them to God as the
price of his failure! After watching over them for a few
weeks, he left them in good hands, and turned his attention
again to foreign mission work. The east had been closed
to him, but that was no reason why the west should not
open. The enemies of the Christians were as powerful in
Spain and North Africa, as in Egypt and the Holy Land.
The infidels had just been defeated in battle, and all
Europe was talking about the victory gained at Las Navas
Tolva. The heart of Francis mourned over these defeated
ones. "Supposing they had been defeated," he argued,
"their natures were still unchanged, their souls were still
unsaved." He began to question if their need was not his
call. He thought he heard them crying, "Pass over and
help us!" He offered himself to God for this work, and,
taking with him his well-beloved Bernardo di Quintavalle,
set out for Spain. He had another rough experience of
the sea, but this time he reached his goal without any
mishap.</p>

<p>It was autumn when they landed in Spain, and without
loss of time, they set off for the interior. At the outset of
the journey, a little incident occurred which, though
unpleasant at the time, God over-ruled for good. They
were passing a vineyard, and Bernardo, who was very
thirsty, plucked a bunch of grapes to refresh himself with.
This was quite an allowable action in Italy, but Spain
appeared to have a different code of morals, and one of the
servants of the owner seized Bernardo, called him a rogue
and a thief, and insisted upon his paying for what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
taken. Bernardo explained that he had no idea of doing
wrong, and that he did not possess the smallest piece of
money. The man snatched at his mantle, and said that
would have to pay for it. But Francis, without discussing
the matter with the servant, insisted upon seeing the
owner of the vineyard. To him he explained the state of
affairs; the mantle was given back, Bernardo was
apologized to, and the good Spaniard did even more, he
offered his services to Francis, and threw open his house,
which became a sort of hostelry for the Order, and any
brother was always welcome, night or day, to the best that
there was.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Will of the Lord.</i></div>

<p>Francis' intention was to go straight to the Mussulmans.
He even talked of reaching Morocco. But God led him to
stay in Spain longer than he had expected. People were
converted everywhere, and branches of the work were
established. Who took charge of these new ventures we
are not told; doubtless friars from Italy were sent
there.</p>

<p>Just as he began to see his way clear to go to the
Mussulmans, he was seized with a violent fever. For
some time he lay between life and death, and when at last
he began to get well, it was perfectly evident that there
could be no talk of his going to Morocco. Always submissive,
Francis accepted this as the will of the Lord and
returned to Italy. The reason why he was led back to the
Portiuncula at that particular time seemed to him quite
plain afterwards; for, when he got there, he found a
number of learned and noble men waiting to offer themselves
to him.</p>

<p>Exactly what Francis did after this is not quite clear.
Probably he preached round about the North of Italy, and
visited the various branches of the work, instructing
novices, and establishing fresh centres. At the beginning
of the next year we find him attending a conference in
Rome, respecting the recovery of the Holy Land. While
here, he met Dominic for the first time. Dominic was
the founder of another kind of Friar Order. He conceived
a great admiration for Francis, and tried very hard to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
him to consent to amalgamate the two. This Francis
never would consent to do, and the two always remained
distinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ugolin's Visit.</i></div>

<p>The decision of the conference was that the Pope himself
should lead a crusade into the Holy Land. He left
Rome in May, and passed through the valley of Assisi,
where Francis was presiding over a general Chapter. At
Perugia he was taken ill with fever. One of his near
relatives, Cardinal Ugolino, accompanied him. This man
had heard a great deal about Francis from Cardinal Paul,
who had just died, and he thought that now would be a
good chance to see for himself. Accordingly, followed by
his magnificent suite, he travelled back to Assisi. All he
saw filled him with wonder; it bore to him the mark of
true holiness. What struck him most was the poverty of
it the brethren. He had no idea they carried it so far. He
went through the roughly constructed cells, saw the beds
made of straw, more like the lairs of wild animals, and
he could not restrain his tears.</p>

<p>"Alas!" he cried to those who were with him, "what
will become of us who need so many superfluities in our
lives!"</p>

<p>Ugolino did not stop there. He felt impelled to offer
himself to fill the place of Cardinal Paul as Protector of
the Order.</p>

<p>"I offer myself to you," he said to Francis; "if you
wish it, I will be your helper, counsellor, and support!"</p>

<p>Francis first of all thanked God, and then he answered,
"It is with all my heart I salute you, the father and
Protector of our religion. I wish all my brothers to you consider
you as such!"</p>

<p>There are some historians who declare that this friendship&mdash;for
a very real friendship sprang up between Francis
and Ugolino&mdash;was no advantage to the Order, but rather
harmed it. There is no evidence of this among the best
authorities; they lean rather to a contrary opinion, and
we are inclined to believe ourselves that the Order would
never have developed as it did but for Cardinal Ugolino.
He went back and told the Pope what he had seen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the old man rejoiced greatly. It was the last joy he had
on earth, for he died a few days later.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Growth of the Order.</i></div>

<p>Time went on, the Order spread and spread till it was
impossible for one man to do justice to the whole. To
meet the growing need for oversight, Italy was divided
into several provinces, these provinces were to be directed
by brothers who were called "Ministers" or "Provincial
Servants." Francis named Peter Catani for Umbria,
Elias for Tuscany, Bennet of Arezzo for the Marches of
Ancona, John of Stracchai for Lombardy, Daniel for
Calabria. Then it was also decided that Bernardo di
Quintavelle was to take charge of Spain, and John of
Penna, Germany. Francis himself was to take France, a
land he had always been especially drawn to. It was
through the intervention of Ugolino that he forewent this
mission. Francis stopped at Florence on his way to tell
him of his journey. Ugolino saw what Francis could not
see, that in view of all their new ventures he could not
afford to leave the country just then. Francis argued that
he could not stay at home in safety and let the brothers go
abroad on dangerous missions, it would raise talk.
Ugolino wanted to know if Italy wasn't big enough for
him. Francis replied that God had raised them up for
the good of the whole world.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Ugolino, "but in any case <i>you</i> cannot
go away yet without imprudence. Your Order is only
just started, you know the opposition it met with at first;
its enemies are not yet disarmed, and your presence is
necessary to defend and maintain it."</p>

<p>Francis saw that Ugolino spoke wisely, and he gave in
and stayed at home. For some time he was the guest of
the Cardinal, and their mutual liking for each other was
greatly increased. The more Ugolino saw of Francis the
more he loved him, and though he could not see eye to eye
with him in everything at first, he eventually came round
to his ways. As much as possible Francis lived his simple
manner of life in the Cardinals palace. He prayed and
meditated, he went out to preach and to beg, and he even
brought back his alms into the palace! One day there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
were a great many people at the table, and Francis was
eating the scraps he had begged. Some of the guests
began to joke him about it, but Francis maintained that
his food was angels' bread, and if they liked he would share
it with them. All&mdash;prelates, knights and nobles&mdash;accepted
willingly, some ate their portion, others put it by
to keep as a memento. But Ugolino was a little hurt.
He took Francis aside and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Quarrel.</i></div>

<p>"Ah, my brother, wherefore all this begging; you hurt
me. Do you not know that my house is yours and your
brethren's?"</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Francis, "I have not affronted
you; I think I have honored you by imitating in your
house our Lord Jesus Christ who taught us to love poverty.
For, indeed, I mean only to follow the footsteps of my
Master!"</p>

<p>The Cardinal bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Do, my brother, what seems good to you," he said,
"the Lord is with you!"</p>

<p>This visit of Francis' to Florence resulted in the
establishment of a large convent on the borders of Tuscany
and Umbria. This is how it came about. The powerful
family of the lords of Baschi were divided. The three sons
were in open rebellion on account of questions of personal
interest, and they were doing their best to drag into this
quarrel the numerous friends of their clients and vassals.
It was plain to be seen that bloodshed would be the outcome.
Francis was very much grieved when he heard of
this dissension, and felt that he must do his best to stop it.
Accordingly, he visited the three brothers, Ugolino,
Buonconte and Ranicu, in turn, and entreated them in the
name of Christ to desist. He succeeded in accomplishing
his end, they laid down their arms, amicably settled the
vexed question, and a charter of reconciliation was drawn
up. Then, wishing to show their gratitude to Francis,
they presented him with a beautiful hill, and, building a
monastery on it, begged of him to send friars to establish a
work there.</p>

<p>A little later, the Cardinal presided over what was known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the "Chapter of Mats," so called because the brothers lived
under little tents made of matting. He was very much
surprised at all he saw, and said he never expected to find
a well-disciplined army! This was a very important
Chapter, and many new Provinces were formed. It was
conducted very much like the preceding ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Failure of the German Mission.</i></div>

<p>It was either in the middle or just before this Chapter,
that the German-Hungarian expedition returned. Their
mission had been an utter failure! When questioned as
to the reason of this failure, they answered, unanimously&mdash;</p>

<p>"No one knows us; our dress, our loneliness, excite distrust.
The clergy have united to drive us away, they
called us heretics, and left us without defence or protection.
We fell into the hands of wicked men and thieves, who
ill-treated us; we had to come away!"</p>

<p>This sounded very badly, but the explanation of it lay in
the fact that they did not understand the language of the
people they went to! How it happened that they were
sent, not knowing the language, we cannot say. Perhaps
Francis thought that French and Italian would be spoken,
or, at least, understood in these countries, or it may be he
expected them to be endowed with the gift of tongues.
Those who went to Germany knew but one word of the
language, "ja"&mdash;"yes." In the first town they entered
they attracted a great deal of notice, and people asked
them if they would like food and a lodging. They did not
understand a word of what was said, but they smiled and
said "ja." Finding themselves well treated, they determined
to use this expression on all occasions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the next one asked them if they were
heretics, and had come to Germany to preach an evil doctrine.
When they again smiled and answered "ja," to their grief
and amazement, they were cast into prison, and after having
been ill-treated for some time, were driven out of the country.</p>

<p>At the close of the "Chapter of Mats," Francis announced
that he was about to proceed to Egypt to preach to the
Sultan. Ugolino had decided that things were now on
such a solid foundation that he could with safety leave the
Order while he took this long journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Francis' Visit to the Sultan. Discouragements.</span></h3>

<div class="poem01"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I must not fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor be discouraged. In the work of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man may turn or falter."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Francis and his companion Illuminato set out for Egypt
with the intention of making straight for the Sultan. They
travelled with one of the Crusading parties, which, by a
curious coincidence, was commanded by John of Brienne,
brother to that Walter of Brienne whom Francis would
have enlisted under, only God sent him back to his native
town! That Francis made a good impression upon the
Crusaders we know, for one of their number writes of
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We saw Brother Francis, Founder of the Order of Minors,
arrive; he is a simple man, but very lovable, and dear to
God as well as to men, and is much respected by all."</p>

<p>The impression the Crusaders made upon Francis was
not so favorable! There was a great deal of discord
among them. The Knights looked down on the men-at-arms,
and the men-at-arms called the Knights treacherous.
Francis had grave doubts as to the result of <i>their</i> expedition
from the beginning. Immediately upon landing, the
Crusaders had planned to do battle with the Saracens.
This line of action was totally opposed to Francis' ideas of
Christianity.</p>

<p>"I know, by a revelation of the Lord," he said to
Illuminato, "that they will be defeated in this attempt. If
I tell them so, they will treat me as a madman; and, on
the other hand, if I do not tell them my conscience will
condemn me. What do you think I ought to do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"My brother," said Illumiuato, who was a man of
virtue and intelligence, "what does the world's judgment
matter to you? If they say you are mad, it will not be
the first time they have said so! Do not burden your
conscience; fear God rather than man!"</p>

<p>So Francis was true to his conscience, and warned the
Crusaders, but they laughed him to scorn! They rushed
into a battle, and were utterly defeated. Six thousand
Christians were killed or taken prisoners. During the
battle Francis was very anxious and unhappy, and often he
wept bitterly for those whom he had tried to save!</p>

<p>Now that force had failed, Francis felt that his time
had come. He would go to the Sultan. The Crusaders,
what were left of them, in their turn, tried to dissuade
him. They told him that he could not get from one camp
to another without being killed, and that the Sultan had
offered a golden reward to anyone who would bring the
head of a Christian. He replied that he did not fear death,
and would make the attempt. First though, before he
set out, he went to one of the Cardinals who were with
the Crusaders, and told him what he proposed doing. A
contemporary writer preserves for us this interview. He
writes, probably in a letter to some friend&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Two Clerks.</i></div>

<p>"Now I must tell you that two Clerks (Francis and
Illuminato) were in the Army, and they came to the
Cardinal. They said that they would go to the Sultan to
preach, and they wished to go with his leave. The
Cardinal said they should not go with his leave, for he
knew well if they went they would not escape. Still they
said, would he suffer them to go, and much they prayed
him. Then, when he heard that they had so great a mind
to go, he said thus: 'I do not know your thoughts at all,
but beware if you go that your thoughts are always to
God.' They said they only wished to go for great good, if
they could accomplish it. Then the Cardinal said they
could go if they wished, and they departed from the
Christian host into the host of the Saracens."</p>

<p>Francis was full of confidence. As he travelled he
sang, "Though I walk in the midst of shadows of death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
I fear no evil." On his way he met two little sheep.
This sight gave him much cheer.</p>

<p>"Be of good comfort," he said to Illuminato, "it is the
accomplishment of the words of the Gospel, 'Behold I send
you as sheep in the midst of wolves.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Saracens.</i></div>

<p>And the wolves were not very far behind. They appeared
in the shape of some Saracen soldiers, who taking them at
first for refugees or envoys let them go quietly on, but
when they found out that the brethren had no message and
that they not only refused to give up the Christian religion,
but had come to preach it, they abused them and loaded
them with chains. Francis never lost his presence of
mind. He knew one word of Arabic, and that was
"Soldan"&mdash;Sultan. As the soldiers beat him he cried
lustily "Soldan, Soldan," and they understood that he
wanted to be taken to their Chief.</p>

<p>The Sultan was called by the Arabs, Malek-Camel, or
the "Perfect Prince." He was very far from being a
perfect character, but for a Mussulman, he was not
ferocious. When Francis and Illuminato came before
him they saluted him. Malek-Camel saluted them, and
asked if they wished to become Saracens, or had they come
with a message.</p>

<p>"Saracens we will never be," they said, "but we have
come with a message from God that will save your life.
For we say that if you die under this law you are lost, and
for that we have come to you, and if you will listen to us
we will show you that you are lost!"</p>

<p>The Sultan said meekly that he had very good Archbishops
and Bishops of his own.</p>

<p>"Of this we are glad," the missionaries replied, "send
and fetch them."</p>

<p>So the Sultan actually sent and fetched eight. He told
them what they were wanted for, and repeated to them
his conversation with Francis. But there was no mercy
in this quarter.</p>

<p>"Sire," they said, "thou art expert in the law and art
bound to maintain and guard it; we command thee by
Mahomet, who gave it to us, that their heads be cut off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
We will hear nothing that they say, we command thee to
have their heads cut off." With that final decision they
filed solemnly away, leaving Francis, Illuminato and the
Sultan alone.</p>

<p>"Seigneurs," the Sultan said, "they have commanded
me by Mahomet and the law to have your heads cut off.
This the law commands. But I will go against the law,
for else I should render thee a very poor reward for having
risked death to save my soul."</p>

<p>In a second interview he had with them he promised
them possessions and lands if they would only stay with
him!</p>

<p>"Yes," said Francis, "if you will be converted, with
your people I will gladly remain." Then, a bright idea
striking him, he went on&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Trial by Fire!</i></div>

<p>"Your priests will not talk with me, perhaps they would
be more ready to act. Have a great fire lighted, I will go
into the fire with them, and you will see by the result
which faith is the surest and holiest."</p>

<p>When Francis had begun this speech there were a
number of priests standing round about, but before he had
finished they had quietly taken themselves off! The idea
filled them with horror! The Sultan perceiving their
absence, remarked sarcastically&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not think that any of <i>my</i> priests are inclined to
face flames and torture for the defence of their faith."</p>

<p>Francis couldn't understand how anybody with a real
faith could refuse to have it tested! He offered to go into
the fire alone, and if he were burnt it was to be considered
due to his sins, but if God protected him, the Sultan was
to own Him as Supreme. But the Sultan would not hear
of any such trial. He was amazed and astonished at the
absolute faith and trust of the man before him.</p>

<p>With this refusal Francis retired. He was followed by
rich presents from the Sultan, all of which were promptly
returned. The Sultan begged of him to take them for his
Churches and Order, but Francis persisted in his refusal,
and seeing that there was no germ of real religion in the
Sultan's heart, he returned to the Crusaders' Camp. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was heavy and sore in soul because he felt his mission to
be a failure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Victory.</i></div>

<p>But if he had failure in one direction, he had victory in
another. The news of his visit to the Sultan spread, and
wherever he was, people flocked to see and hear him, and
recruits such as he had never expected, began to gather
round him. The following fragment of a letter written
by one of the Crusaders to a friend, shows us how they
regarded his work.</p>

<p>"Master Regnier, Prior of St. Michael's, has entered
the Order of Friars Minor. This Order is making rapid
progress in the world, because it exactly reproduces the
form of the Primitive Church, and closely imitates the life
of the Apostles. The Superior of these brethren is
Brother Francis, a man of such goodness that we all hold
him in veneration. After he came among us, so great was
his zeal that he did not fear to go into the Army of our
enemies, and preach, during several days, the Word of God
to the Saracens. He had not much success, but on his
departure, the Sultan King of Egypt asked him secretly to
pray for him that he might be guided by an inspiration
from above, and attach himself to the religion most
approved by God. Colin, the Englishman, one clerk, and
two other of our companions, to wit, Michel and Master
Mathieu, to whom I have entrusted the care of my Church,
have also entered the Order of Minors, and I can hardly
keep back the Cantor and several others! As to myself,
with my body weakened, and my heart oppressed by all
these separations, I aspire to end my life in peace and
quiet."</p>

<p>Thus when Francis failed, God caused even that failure
to be productive of good. The whole question of failure is
a very subtle one, and it is a matter of grave doubt as to
whether God's errands ever do really fail&mdash;what we call
failure according to our preconceived ideas, may simply be
God's way of working. True, the Sultan was not converted
(though there is a legend to the effect that when he
was on his death-bed he sent for a Franciscan friar, and
professed conversion), but to-day, at time of writing, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Franciscans are spread out all over the Holy Land. They
have schools and churches and orphanages in every part of
the country.</p>

<p>Seventeen years later, John of Brienne, the Commander
of the Crusade, after fighting many battles, and rising to
great earthly glory, became converted and entered a branch
of the Franciscan brotherhood then established in the
Holy Land. This was no doubt due to the influence of
Francis, who by the power of God alone, subdued the
enemies of Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Trial.</i></div>

<p>Upon returning to Italy, a sad trial awaited Francis.
He had determined to visit Bologna on his way back. The
long sea-voyage and hot climate of Egypt had weakened
him very much, so much so that it nearly happened that
he passed on without paying the promised visit. Several
of the brethren round about had met Francis on his way,
as naturally he halted at any monastery on the route. The
conversation that he heard among these brethren troubled
him not a little. He heard that there had been important
additions made to the humble house the lawyer had given
to Bernardo when he came first to Bologna. What put
the finishing touch to his sadness was when an inhabitant
of the city alluded to the building as "the Friars' house,"
then he knew they had departed from their first principles,
for there was no "me" or "mine" in the Order of the
Friars Minor. It was a heavy blow to him, sick and
smarting under a sense of failure as he was, and he
declared that he would not shelter under its roof, but
would go elsewhere and beg for hospitality. He sent a
message to the monastery to command every one of them
to turn out at once! This was done instantly, and even
those who were ill were carried into the street! A
historian, who was a friar at the time, writes, "he who
writes this history was one of the number; he was
taken out of his bed and laid in the street like the
others."</p>

<p>This summary proceeding naturally caused a tremendous
stir in the city, and what the outcome of it would have been
we cannot say if Ugolino, who seems to have had a knack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of turning up at every crisis, had not appeared just then.
He went to Francis, and with great difficulty succeeded in
quieting him. He would never have done this had he not
been able to assure him that the house was his and in no
way belonged to the friars. When Francis saw that the
brethren were in no danger of becoming proprietors, he
allowed them to go back and consented to preach in the
city. History tells us that that preaching was one of the
most glorious on record. It was through it that Professor
Pepoli joined the Friars Minor. But Francis felt keenly
that the government of a multitude is difficult and that increase
of followers does not invariably mean increase of
joy. For several years after this he rather discouraged
than encouraged people to enter the First Order.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Orphans.</i></div>

<p>But the whole Bologna affair made a deep impression
upon Francis. For the first time in his career his brave
spirit suffered defeat, the first declension in principle,
together with his own failing strength was too much for
him. At the next Chapter he presided over, which was
soon after his return from Egypt, he publicly resigned from
the position of Minister General. No one seems to have
been prepared for this action beforehand.</p>

<p>"From this moment," he said, "I am dead to you, but
here is our brother, Peter Cantani; he it is whom both
you and I will henceforth obey."</p>

<p>The brethren were broken-hearted.</p>

<p>"What!" they said through their tears, "are we to lose
our father and become orphans?"</p>

<p>Then Francis stood up and prayed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh my Lord, I commend to Thee this day, this family
which Thou hast entrusted to me. My infirmities, Thou
knowest, make it impossible for me to take care of it. I
put it into the hands of Ministers. If it come to pass
through their negligence, their scandals, or their too great
severity, one of the brethren perish, they will give account
to Thee at the Day of Judgment."</p>

<p>No entreaty or argument could get Francis to alter this
decision. He was a man in the prime of life, and,
humanly speaking, he ought to have had long years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
service before him. Perhaps he felt that already his days
were numbered, and that it was only a question of a few
years at most.</p>

<p>As long as he lived his successors were known as Vicar-Generals.
He would only consent to preserve the title and
rights of Minister General. This arrangement had no serious
results as far as Peter Cantani's government went. He
was a good man, and carried out Francis' idea exactly, so
that Francis could leave all to him, and with a clear
conscience, devote himself to visiting the centres and
preaching. But, unfortunately, Peter Cantani's reign was
a brief one; he died a very short time after his promotion
to the Vicar Generalship.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Storm Clouds.</i></div>

<p>From the death of Peter Cantani till his own death, the
storm-clouds of internal struggle gathered round Francis'
path. His life was not to be all one long, if hard worked
for, success. No! life is not lived thus; there is the dark as
well as the bright in its mosaic, but it is sad, we say in our
humanity, when the dark work is done at the end. But
God, Who is the chief Workman, knows best how He
wants His work ordered; He has His eyes on the beautiful
end, while we fix ours tearfully at the unfinished, and,
therefore, inexplicable pattern.</p>

<p>There was yet, however, one unalloyed joy in store for
Francis before he entered upon his last dark years of
service, one of the greatest social reforms the world has
ever known&mdash;the establishment of the Third or Tertiary
Order of Brothers Minor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

</div></div>


<p>The idea of this Third Order had been in Francis' mind
for a long time; in fact, as far back as his first journey to
Rome, when the entire brotherhood numbered twelve!
On his way home to Assisi he had preached in every village
and town he passed. One day, as he was preaching in the
vicinity of a large feudal castle, the whole establishment
turned out to hear him, and when he had finished, his
listeners, lords and ladies, officers and retainers, threw
themselves at his feet, announcing their intention to follow
him wherever he went, and renounce the world for ever.
Never was preacher in such a plight! There they stood,
the tears running down their faces, husbands and wives
and little children, soldiers, bower-maidens and pages, the
entire retinue that ordinarily made up the household of a
mediæval lord. Francis knew that it would not be possible
to carry off the lot; beside, there was no Second Order
then, and what could he do with the women and children?
So he calmed them by telling them that he would endeavor
to create an Order into which they could come without
shaking the foundations of the universe!</p>

<p>Little he thought that the Third Order was destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to make even more stir in the world than the First or
Second.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What must we do?</i></div>

<p>As the years passed by, Francis was continually met with
the question, "What must we do now we are converted?
Teach us how to live!"</p>

<p>It was a very important question, and a very natural
one, for the first instinct of a healthy, newly-converted
soul is to spend and be spent for its Master. Strange as
it may seem to us in these days of Bible readers, district
visitors, and lay workers of all kinds, it was a very difficult
question to answer. The Church, which as yet was the
Church Universal, not having suffered any disruption,
knew nothing of lay help, other than setting its members
to pray, and give alms. A change of life and action had
long since ceased to be preached. Francis and his
followers had revived the old Apostolic doctrine of
repentance and conversion and holiness of life and thought.
As many as could join the First and Second Orders were
well disposed of, but the countless multitude who were unable
to leave home and friends, were the, as yet, unsolved
problem. Francis soon saw that his work would be, to a
large extent, a failure if something were not done in the
way of organizing his converts. This fact was again
pressed home upon him the year after Peter Cantani was
appointed Vicar General.</p>

<p>He was preaching in a little village called Cannara, and
his hearers, who comprised the major portion of the
village, were so carried away with his words, that they besought
him with tears to take them into his brotherhood.
This he refused to do, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are not able, nor ought you to do anything of the
kind. I will think of you, and I will seek, and with God's
blessing I will find a life more within your compass."</p>

<p>This promise he found he had to renew wherever he
went.</p>

<p>"What must we do?" the people asked him..</p>

<p>"We cannot forsake our wives!" said the husbands,
and "We cannot leave our husbands!" said the wives.
"How shall we save ourselves?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Third Order.</i></div>

<p>After a little, the active mind of Francis found the
way out. He would form a new Order of converted men
and women, who would be linked on to the First, and so,
without leaving the world, they could enjoy the peace and
strength of a truly religious life. Such an idea had never
been heard of before, and the success of the new institution
far surpassed all expectations. It seemed as though men's
hearts and minds had been waiting for it, to judge by the
numbers that sought admission.</p>

<p>The rules of the Order were very simple and based
almost entirely on the Sermon on the Mount. The
"Tertiaries," as they were called, were required to put an
end to all hatred, and to restore all ill-acquired gain, not
to engage in lawsuits, to practise the commandments of
God, to wear a plain dress, and abstain from all worldly
gaieties, such as theatre-going, dancing, etc. No one
might speak of his or her neighbor's faults. They were to
eat the plainest of food and to avoid a variety of dishes.
Then there were various advices given as regards cleanliness.
Mediæval folk seldom reckoned cleanliness among
the virtues to be cultivated. No one was to appear in Church
in soiled or torn clothes, because, in so doing, they showed
disrespect to God, and never should there be stain or spot
on their garments, for outside purity is in some sort a
reflection of inward purity. Houses and furniture also
had to be plain and clean. They spent what time they
had in visiting the sick, and helping those who needed
help out of the surplus of their goods.</p>

<p>Before anybody was admitted into the Order, an
investigation was made into his or her life, respecting
personal character and relations with their neighbors. If
he were found with goods not belonging to him, or to be at
enmity with anyone, he was not admitted until he had
repented and done his first works.</p>

<p>In every place where a congregation of the Third Order
existed, there was a "Visitor" who was also a Minor of
the First Order. It was his duty to oversee these
"Tertiaries," and give them instruction.</p>

<p>Such was the Order in which people of all grades and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
classes hastened to enrol themselves. It was first opened
in June, and at the end of that year we find branches of it
in Tuscany, Umbria, and the Marches of Ancona. A wave
of blessing seemed to pass all over Italy. It does not
appear that Francis established any other fraternity of
the Third Order except the First, and from that the others
spread out into all the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Strong Order.</i></div>

<p>The "Tertiaries," or "The brethren of the Militia of
Jesus Christ," as someone called them, multiplied to such
an extent that very soon they attracted more attention than
was altogether pleasant. The different bishops of Italy
opposed them, and wrote to the German Emperor,
Frederick II., who was a man of bad character and openly
irreligious.</p>

<p>"The Friars Minor have risen up against us!" they
wrote. "They have publicly reproved our life and
conversation. They have destroyed our rights, and
brought us to nothing. And now, as the finishing stroke
against our power, and to deprive us of the devotion of the
people, they have created two new confraternities, which
include men and women. Everyone runs into them!"</p>

<p>Frederick was frightened. He saw a gigantic army
ready to fight for the Church at a word of command,
because one of the bye-laws of Tertian rule forbade the
Tertiaries to carry offensive weapons save in the defence of
the faith of Jesus Christ, or in defence of their country.
From this time Frederick, who was always fighting against
the Church, became their bitterest enemy, and persecuted
them wherever they were to be found. If it had not been
for the influence of Cardinal Ugolino, who vigorously
protected the Third Order after Francis' death, Frederick
would, probably, have been able to wipe it out of existence,
or what would have been worse, it might have existed only
in name. As it was, it grew and spread and struggled for
its rights, till it became one of the most powerful religious,
social and political influences the world has ever felt. To
go into the details of this would occupy too much space,
therefore, we shall turn our attention to a few of the first
Tertiaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lucchese.</i></div>

<p>The <i>very</i> first was a man called Lucchese. This man
was young, good-looking, and ambitious. He was a tradesman,
and his ruling motive in life was to vie with the
nobles. This, after a time, became a passion with him.
He knew the only way to success lay through riches.
Therefore, he determined to be rich. He began to
speculate in grain, and bought up as much as he could,
and thus created an artificial famine in his village. Then,
when the want was greatest, he resold his stores at
enormous prices, and his fortune was made.</p>

<p>But God was looking after him, and, one day, when he
was sitting alone, the thought of what he had done came
before him in all its hideousness. He saw that there was
something more in life besides merely pursuing riches, and
"what would it profit him," something asked him, "if he
should gain all his heart was set on, and be eternally
lost in the end?" From that hour he was a changed
man.</p>

<p>After consultation with his wife, Bonadona, he sold
the greater part of his goods, and distributed their price to
the poor. He kept only a house and a garden of four
acres, which he cultivated with his own hands. This was
a hard life for one who had been used to luxury. His
house soon became the "poor man's inn" for the district.
Thither came the poor and needy in troops, and never
were they sent empty away.</p>

<p>Such was Lucchese's life when he met Francis, just at
the time when the necessity for the Third Order was
pressing most heavily upon him. Lucchese opened his
heart to Francis, and told him how much he longed to
make up for the wrong he had done in the past, and live a
life well-pleasing to God.</p>

<p>"For some time," said Francis, who felt, as Lucchese
talked with him, that the man and the hour had both
arrived, "I have been thinking of founding a Third Order,
in which married people will have an opportunity of
serving God faithfully. You can be the first to enrol
yourself."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lucchese's Work.</i></div>

<p>Then he explained the form which he intended to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
this Order, and Lucchese gladly enrolled himself, and
Bonadona declared that she would join her husband.
Encouraged by this good beginning, Francis publicly
announced his intentions, and a number of men and
women came and offered themselves to him. So, one day,
in the Church, in the sight of many spectators, he clothed
them in a simple, modest dress of ash-grey, and the first
group, or rather the first fraternity, was formed.</p>

<p>Lucchese persevered nobly in his good works. He was no
longer content with merely helping those who came to him,
but he travelled great distances to find the suffering.
Sometimes he was to be seen leading three or four poor
creatures, and carrying the weakest of them on his back!
When once they were in his house, he cared for them, body
and soul, and many of them were converted, and some
joined the Third Order. Close to where Lucchese lived,
there were large tracts of swampy, malarial country.
Every summer fever was sure to break out there.
Lucchese saw this place now as a beautiful field for
Tertiary labor. He bought an ass, and, loading it with
suitable drugs and food, he went down into the fever
swamps, and did his best in the capacity of doctor and
nurse and priest all in one. His wife was always ready to
help him in all his good works.</p>

<p>His death is reported to have been "serene and grand
as that of a patriarch." He and his wife were both taken
ill together. She got worse rapidly, and they came to tell
him of it. They carried him to her side. Kissing her an
affectionate farewell, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my beloved and devoted companion, we have
served God together in all affection. Wait for me, we
shall be permitted to go together to the unspeakable
joys!"</p>

<p>He returned to his room and lay down in great weakness.
Those around saw that his last hour had come.</p>

<p>"My dear brother," said one of the Friars Minor, who
stood beside him, "be strong and prepare thy soul to
appear before thy Saviour."</p>

<p>Lucchese raised his head a little and smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"My good father," he said, "If I had waited till now
to prepare my soul I should still have confidence in God's
mercy, but to tell the truth I should leave the world with
less security, on account of the terrors of the passage."</p>

<p>But the passage had no terrors for Lucchese. He raised
his arms and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel myself free and ready, not through my merits,
but through those of our Lord Jesus Christ." A few
minutes after the death of his wife, he, too, followed her
to Heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Dinner Party.</i></div>

<p>Once, when passing through Rome, Francis was asked
by the chief of a powerful house to dinner. As he was
going into the palace of the noble, he descried a number
of poor people congregated in the court, to whom food was
being distributed. Unable to resist the opportunity, he
went down and sat among them! Matthew de Rubeis,
his host, was looking out of the window and saw this, so
he came out and joined him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother Francis, since you will not come to me, I
must come and sit with you." And with the most courtly
air he announced to the astonished crowd that he and
Francis would eat with them.</p>

<p>After that dinner, during which no doubt Francis
expounded his doctrines, Matthew de Rubeis was enrolled
in the "New Militia." He was the first Tertiary in
Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Little Rose.</i></div>

<p>Little Rose, though not actually a contemporary of
Francis, is always reckoned in as one of the first
Tertiaries. She was one of those children who seem
born with deep religious feeling. She always, from her
earliest dawning intelligence, loved God with all her heart
and soul. She was a beautiful child, very lively in disposition,
and she loved to go out into the streets and sing
hymns. Before she was ten years old, she began to preach
against those who tried to undermine the faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the chief was the German
Emperor, Frederick II. The Archbishop of the town had
written a letter warning his people against the dangers
that beset them, and nowhere did his appeal take deeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
root than in the heart of little Rose. She, childlike, spoke
out boldly what her friends were thinking in their hearts.
Standing in the street, on a large stone, she preached that
the Emperor was an enemy of the true faith, and must be
resisted, and that the standard of the faith must be kept
high at all costs. Those who thought just so encouraged
her, but those who were staunch supporters of the wicked
Emperor went to the Prefect of the town, who belonged to
their party, and declared&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you do not send away Rose and her parents, we will
drive you away yourself."</p>

<p>The Prefect was frightened. He sent for Rose and her
parents, and when they appeared he ordered them, on pain
of being cast into prison, and having their goods confiscated,
to leave the town. It was then the middle of winter,
snow had been falling for some days, and the roads were
nearly impassable. The parents begged to have the
sentence postponed for a little.</p>

<p>"It is death," they said, "to go now."</p>

<p>"Well, you can die then," answered the Prefect. "I
want nothing better."</p>

<p>So they took their child and set off. They did not die,
however. God took care of them, and they safely reached
Soriano, where they lived in peace and quiet, till the death
of the Emperor, a year later, allowed them to return home
again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems a rather strange turn of events that put
Elias in the place of the gentle, devout, Peter Cantani. No
one could doubt Elias' efficiency. That was beyond all
question, but that he had a proud, self-willed spirit was
also indisputable. Francis' mind at first turned towards
Bernardo di Quintavelle as Peter's successor. He always
had a peculiar love for this, his first son. But though
Bernardo had risen to considerable importance in the
Order, yet for some time he had been harassed with
interior temptations, and had been subject to great
darkness. Though Francis was not troubled very much by
this experience of Bernardo's, saying "It is a trial, he will
come out of it, and be the greater for it afterwards," yet
he did not think it wise to put him in any new position of
authority, as his own trials would not leave him quite free
for his work. So Bernardo was passed over, and Elias
filled the vacant Vicar Generalship.</p>

<p>Elias' Government was active. Splendid order reigned
in all the communities. He was unequalled for clearness
of business views, and his preaching was greatly sought
after.</p>

<p>Some historians say that with all Francis' gifts of perception
he never until it was too late saw into Elias'
character, and that the pride and self-will which were so
evident to others were hidden to him. Elias loved show
and external greatness rather than interior goodness and
holiness. He loved Francis, but he thought he was far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
more capable of filling the Vicar Generalship than he. He
regarded Francis as one to be admired, not imitated. It is
quite certain that if Francis had had the faintest idea that
the Order would suffer through Elias, he never would have
elected him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Germany Again.</i></div>

<p>Elias entered his new appointment in a blaze of glory.
He had come from the Minister Generalship of Tuscany,
the most important post in the Order, which he had
managed in a very skilful manner. Then another event
had just happened which added to the lustre of his
reputation. A celebrated German preacher, Cesar of
Spiers, had attended his preachings and entered the Order.
Elias was installed at the next Chapter before five thousand
brethren. It was at this Chapter, that on the seventh day
they had to beg of the people not to bring them any more
food, and even then they had to prolong the Chapter two
days, in order to eat up all the provisions that had been
donated! Elias presided at the last sitting, which was the
one when the brethren received their appointments. We
have told you how unfortunate the first German expedition
had been and how the poor brethren returned more dead
than alive with fright. Well, during the course of this last
sitting, Francis felt impressed that they ought to make
another attempt for the salvation of Germany. As he was
not very well that day, and unable to make himself heard,
he pulled Elias by the tunic, and whispered to him aside.
Elias stood up and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brethren, this is what the Brother tells me,"
they always called Francis "The Brother." "There is a
country, Germany, whose inhabitants are Christians, and
full of devotion. You have often seen them passing
through our country walking in the sunshine with long
sticks and great boots, singing the praises of God.
Several of our brethren have already been amongst them.
They did not succeed, and had to come back. Now I compel
none of you to undertake this mission again, but if
anyone is sufficiently filled with zeal for the glory of God
and the salvation of souls to venture upon it they can give
in their names."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Unwilling Volunteer.</i></div>

<p>A wave of horror ran through the assembly, for no
mission was more dreaded, but very soon they recovered
themselves, and about ninety gave in their names, several
of whom were of German origin. Among this last number
was Cesar of Spiers, who was appointed Minister for
Germany. A rather amusing incident occurred in connection
with this expedition.</p>

<p>The ninety volunteers were all told to come out of
the ranks, and stand together till those who were to go
were chosen. As they stood waiting there a certain brother
called Giordano, who was one of those most scared at the
idea of a mission to Germany, and had taken good care
not to volunteer, thought he would go and have a look
at them.</p>

<p>Giordano had a spirit of investigation that would have
led him into the ranks of journalism had he lived only a
few centuries later!</p>

<p>"They will certainly die," he said to himself, "and it
will be as with the martyrs of Morocco. I shall not even
have known them by name."</p>

<p>With that he took himself off on an unauthorized interviewing
tour, and accosting each one he said,</p>

<p>"Who are you? What is your country?" Then, as
he told himself, when he heard of their martyrdom, he
could say, "Oh, I knew this one, and the other one." It
was not a very lofty object, but it was an exceeding
natural one.</p>

<p>In time his investigations brought him to a brother who
was a bit of a wag, and who, unluckily for Giordano,
knew of his horror of Germany.</p>

<p>"I am called Palmerio, and I come from Gargano," he
replied meekly, when questioned, "but, my brother," he
continued, "you are one of us, you are going too."</p>

<p>"No, no, I am not," cried Giordano. "I only want to
know you."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are," insisted Palmerio, and taking him
by the shoulders, he held him amongst the volunteers.
Giordano was still struggling for liberty when Cesar was
appointed Minister, and told to choose those out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
ninety whom he would like to have with him. Several
of the brethren who had entered into the joke with
Palmerio surrounded him, and begged him not to leave
out brother Giordano.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To go, or not to go.</i></div>

<p>"I'm not going. I'm not going," cried Giordano.</p>

<p>Cesar looked at him, and seeing he was a suitable candidate,
was inclined to have him. He, knowing that his
countrymen were neither savages nor man-eaters, and that
there was not the slightest danger to fear, was rather at a
loss to understand the fuss.</p>

<p>"Will you or will you not go to Germany? You must
decide," he said to Giordano.</p>

<p>This threw Giordano into great perplexity. If he did
not go to Germany, he feared his conscience would condemn
him, seeing that he was chosen, and if he went, the
Germans were ferocious, and he <i>knew</i> he would not make
a good martyr! He consulted a Brother who had been
robbed fifteen times during the last Hungarian mission.</p>

<p>"In your place," advised the man, "I should not
choose. I would say I shall neither go nor stay. I will
do as you say."</p>

<p>Giordano followed this advice, and was chosen for
Germany! He got the better of his fears and worked
bravely, and his journalistic talents were used in compiling
a valuable chronicle, which tells how the Minors were
established in Germany.</p>

<p>The next most important event in the history of the
Order was the establishment of a school for theology and
training. This was begun by Anthony, whom you will
remember best under the name of Fernandez, and who
was led into the Order by the death of the five Morocco
martyrs. He was not only deeply religious, but very
learned. Upon hearing him preach one Easter, some of
the brethren who were present got the idea that a school
was needed in the Order, and that Anthony would make a
splendid head. They laid this plan before Elias, who
highly approved of it, and undertook to present it to
Francis. To convince Francis was quite another matter,
and for some time he would not hear of it. But Elias was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
a clever reasoner, and he got Francis at last to listen to the
plans. Still he hesitated. His ideal had always been
Apostolic preaching, and he dreaded any change in his
beloved Order. At last he gave in, and wrote his consent
to Anthony thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Definite Rule.</i></div>

<p>"I consent to your teaching holy theology to our brethren,
on condition that such teaching does not stifle the spirit
of prayer, either in yourself or others. I hold firmly to
this point, for it is our rule."</p>

<p>Whether this step was a good or bad one, we cannot
say. We only know that under Anthony no harm came of
it, but rather good. With all his brilliancy and keenness
of intellect, and in spite of the way men ran after him and
honoured him, he still kept his simple faith and humble
spirit.</p>

<p>After the Chapter we have already described, Francis
took a tour with Elias into his late province, Tuscany, and
then, on his return, he set himself down to compile a
definite and comprehensive rule for the benefit of posterity,
and to which future generations would be able to refer.
Probably the laxities of Elias, which were beginning to make
themselves manifest, strengthened Francis in his determination
to leave his articles of faith behind him in such
tangible form that there could be no questioning the
principle and line of action. Elias' influence was being felt
all round. The devotion to poverty was not what it once
was, and the love of authority and office was doing its deadly
poisonous work in the hearts of some. Francis' decision
to draw up a definite rule was far from agreeable to Elias
and his set.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was done. Taking with him Leo and
Bonizio, Francis went off to a hermitage, and there he
dictated the new rule. On his return to Assisi he gave it
to Elias to read, telling him to take care of it. When Elias
read it, he found that it entirely did away with many of
his most cherished plans, so a few days later, when
Francis asked him for the rule again, he said that he had
lost it. Francis answered never a word. He returned to the
same solitude with the same companions, and dictated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Rule a second time. This Rule has been handed down to
us intact. It is very largely an amplication of those first
verses of the Gospel which were to Francis his call to his
life-work. It is remarkable for its clearness. If any
Brother transgressed this Rule, he did it with his eyes
open, and knew what he was doing too. There is no sign
of any laxity in it. As Francis advanced in years, he
became more and more strongly attached to that
simplicity of faith and work which was the light of all
his life.</p>

<p>At the next Chapter a copy of the Rule was given to all
the Brethren. They were told to carry it about with them
always, and learn it by heart, and repeat it often to
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Keeping Christmas.</i></div>

<p>It was drawing near Christmas time when this Rule was
finally passed by the Church, and as Francis was in Rome
just then he determined to put in practice an idea which
long had been simmering in his brain. It was an innovation,
but then he was convinced that it would make men
think more deeply of the Holy Baby that was born to bring
peace and goodwill to earth. Accordingly, he sent the
following message to a nobleman named John, who was
devotedly attached to Francis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish to keep Christmas night with you, and, if you
agree, this is how we will celebrate it. You will choose
a place in your woods, a grotto if there is one, you will
put in it a manger and hay: there must be an ox and an
ass also. It must as much as possible be like the manger
at Bethlehem."</p>

<p>All was prepared, and when Christmas night came an
immense multitude, carrying torches and lighted tapers,
poured through the dark, midnight woods to the grotto.
The Brethren sang carols as they came, and these were
caught up by the people till the forest resounded again and
again. Francis himself led this mighty procession to the
manger, and there, standing at its head, the oxen and asses
pressing close beside him, and the flaring torches lighting
up the whole with an unearthly lurid light, he preached to
them about the meek and lowly Jesus, Who came to earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to be despised, persecuted, and put to death. It was a
time of much blessing, and that night saw a dawning of
"peace and goodwill" in souls once darkened and lifeless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A Great Task.</i></div>

<p>But all this time, ever since he returned from Egypt,
Francis' health was slowly but surely failing. Weak and
ill, and with the lurking fear that the principles of the
Order were being undermined, his last two years of life
were anything but peaceful ones. Not that there was
anything done openly&mdash;that was the misery of it; an open,
bold innovation could have been taken hold of and dealt
with, but Elias was far too politic and clever to do anything
that might lead to his being put out of office. Any
question of departure from the rules that came up, he
always blamed on the Provincial Ministers, and professed
to be as grieved over their failure as Francis himself
though secretly he supported them. He carefully gave all
the truest Franciscans appointments far away from Assisi
and Francis, and kept those of his own mind near home.
This was not a bad thing for the ultimate success of the
Order, because it preserved the real spirit abroad, and
when Bernardo di Quintavelle stepped into Elias'
place, ultimately, he had all his foes close to hand
round home, where the Franciscan principles had taken
deepest root.</p>

<p>It was hard for Francis when one after another of his
faithful followers came to him, and with tears reproached
him for having given them into the hands of another.
When they at last took in the fact that though the spirit
might be willing, the flesh was too weak to do what it had
once been able to do, their sorrow knew no bounds.
Some of them were almost a little selfish in their grief.</p>

<p>"You will pass away," said one. "Your family will
remain in the valley of tears. Who can take charge and
direct it after you? If you know of one on whom your
mind can rest, I conjure you to tell me."</p>

<p>"My son," said Francis, with tears, "I see no one
around me equal to this task of being shepherd to so great
a flock."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Foes.</i></div>

<p>Thus, tortured by bodily pain and weakness, and tor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>mented
by unseen foes and enemies of all that he counted
dearest and most sacred, he entered upon the two last dark
years, which were his Valley of the Shadow before the
Eternal Sun rose, never to set again.</p>

<p>Slowly, but surely, the time came when Francis was
compelled to drop all attempt at work. We do not read
that he suffered or grieved over this&mdash;not even when the
blindness which had been gradually creeping upon him
suddenly climaxed, and he was plunged into almost total
darkness. In the midst of all, his faith shone brighter
and brighter, and his love for God grew in intensity. His
confidence in God was such, that when he found himself,
in what ought to have been the prime of life, a broken-down,
pain-tortured wreck, not the faintest shadow of a
regret for the golden years that "might have been," had
his path been a less stormy one, ruffled the interior calm
of his soul. His life had been lived, and was being lived
in the will of God, and nothing outside that will could
possibly happen to him. So, in the serene confidence that
<i>all</i> things&mdash;no matter how disastrous they might appear to
human understanding&mdash;would surely work together for
good, he lay down in his narrow cell at the Portiuncula, to
<i>suffer</i> the Divine will with the same glad, ready obedience
with which he had heretofore hastened to perform it. In
no instance do we read of his faith failing him. Not for
the smallest fraction of a second. The story of his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
days is one of the most vivid pictures of the triumph of
a soul over every earthly hindrance. It has its parallel in
the story of Gethsemane and Calvary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<i>Thy Will be Done.</i>"</div>

<p>Before we continue our narrative, let us for a moment
take a realizing view of Francis, his condition and circumstances.
As we have said before, his health was utterly
undermined. We are told that "the stomach could ill bear
food, the internal organs were the seat of constant sufferings,
and all the members were weakened and painful."
Add to this almost total blindness, and we have a state of
body that would in itself be sufficient excuse for any phase
of soul-difficulty, darkness, or depression, had such assailed
him. But how much worse than his bodily pains must
have been the heart-agony he suffered through the insidious,
elusive disease that was sapping the vitality of the vast
organization of which he was the tender Father. To the
very dregs Francis drained that cup of failure and defeat,
which all who are called to lead the vanguard of Christ's
conquering host, have at some time or another to drink
more or less deeply. That is the time when the cry, "If
it be possible, let this cup pass from me," is wrung from
the tortured soul, and thrice happy are those who, out of an
intimate knowledge of God, can add, "Not my will, but Thine
be done," assured that it is best simply because it is His.
But it is only those who know God and enjoy Him, who
have confidence enough in Him not to demand His reasons&mdash;those
whose lives have not been mere service alone&mdash;who
can triumphantly and victoriously cry, "Thy will be done."
Such was Francis. Such were those of the whitest of
God's saints, and a like eternal, triumphant victory is ours,
if we, too, are willing to pay the full price&mdash;a life of utter
self-renunciation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Operation.</i></div>

<p>But to return. Up to the time when Francis became
blind, he had steadily refused to see any doctor or take any
medicine; but after much persuasion, on the part of the
brethren and Ugolino, who firmly believed that the Order
would suffer collapse if Francis died, he gave in to their
request, and tried every remedy the Assisian doctors
presented. But he became no better, and from Assisi he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
was taken to Rieti, to consult an oculist there. He
suffered everything from the rude, barbarous surgical
treatment of the times, which knew little beyond cauterization,
bleeding, and drawing-plasters. But, as he became
rather worse than better, the Rieti oculist, who had learned
to love him, took him on to Siena, to see an old, celebrated
oculist who lived in that town. This man said that there
was nothing for it but an operation&mdash;a very painful one, too,
for he would have to cauterize his patient from the eyebrows
to the ears. Francis said he was ready to undergo
it. He thought to himself that this was a glorious
chance to show that Christ's soldiers could be as brave as
any others. One moment only he shuddered. This was
when the doctors were heating their instruments in the
fire, and he knew that soon he would have to endure
them. In those days only the very stoutest-hearted
submitted to operations, the majority preferring to die
untortured. One can hardly blame them, as there were no
means known by which the faculties could be deadened.</p>

<p>Before the hot irons touched him, Francis prayed, and
then addressed the fire thus:</p>

<p>"My brother fire: among all beautiful things the Lord
has created thee, beautiful, strong, useful. Be gentle to
me this hour. May God, who created thee, temper thine
ardour, that I may be able to bear it." With that he
gave himself into the surgeon's hands, and without a
groan he underwent the operation. The brethren who
were with him, ran away the moment it began. Francis
called them back.</p>

<p>"Oh, faint-hearted cowards!" he said, "Why did you
run away! I tell you in truth the iron did not hurt me!
I felt no pain."</p>

<p>Then, turning to the doctor he said, "If it be not well
burnt, thrust it in again."</p>

<p>The doctor, who knew the terror most people felt at such
operations, exclaimed in amazement&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friends, this day I have seen wonders!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Failing Health.</i></div>

<p>For a little time the operation seems to have succeeded,
and the winter passed away with alternations of good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
bad health. Francis spent the largest portion of his time
in prayer and meditation, and after that he was able to see
the number who daily begged for the privilege of visiting
him for consultation and help. His memory, writes a
historian, served him for a book, and furnished him with
the principles and facts he needed on every subject. "The
important thing," Francis used to say to himself, "is not
to have understood a great number of truths, but sincerely
to love each truth&mdash;to let each one penetrate the heart by
degrees, to let it rest there, to have the same object in
view for a long time, to unite one's self to it more by the
sentiment of the heart than by subtle reflections."</p>

<p>In the early days of spring Francis was seized with such
a violent hemorrhage that everyone thought his end had
come. Elias was hastily sent for, but before he could
arrive all immediate danger was past. However, as soon
as he was able, Francis determined to travel back to
Assisi. His was the true Italian nature, whose heart
always turns towards home, as a sunflower to the sun!
He must have had a revival of strength just here, because
we read of his standing on a stone in the cemetery at
Cortona, preaching to the people. But he was not deluded
into thinking that this meant recovery. Oh, no, he told
the people plainly that he was on his way to Assisi to die.</p>

<p>For two months he stayed in Cortona, detained there
by the people, who refused to part with him, and then he
was seized with dropsy and fever. He begged to be taken
back to his native land. It was his last wish, and they
at once carried out his desire. For fear the Perugians&mdash;through
whose town they had to pass&mdash;would also try
to detain him, Elias sent a messenger to the magistrates
of Assisi asking them for an escort back. The magistrates
immediately sent a party of armed men on horseback,
chosen partly from the nobles, and partly from the
principal men of the town. They surrounded the litter
in which Francis was laid, and the journey commenced.
It was a curious procession, the worn invalid, lying on his
hard couch, and borne by his brown-robed, bare-footed
brethren, and round them the brilliant costumes and gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
trappings of the nobles and their prancing horses. Did
Francis, we wonder, compare his present position with
that day some twenty years back, when hunted and
hounded through his native town, he was glad to take
refuge in a cave! If he did, we may be sure that to God
he gave all the glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<i>For the Love of God.</i>"</div>

<p>Francis took a keen delight when as it happened he was
able to prove to his gay escort by ocular demonstration the
power of his beloved poverty. They were stopping at a
tiny mountain village in order to let him rest, and as they
had no food, the men set out to buy some. They came
back a little later, very discomfited and not a little cross.
The people had refused to sell them any, saying loftily,
"We are not shopkeepers."</p>

<p>"We are reduced to living upon your alms," the men
said to Francis, "we cannot find anything to buy."</p>

<p>Francis enjoyed their dilemma hugely.</p>

<p>"You have found nothing," he explained, "because
you have trusted in your money more than God. But
return where you have been, and instead of offering money
ask food for the love of God. Do not be ashamed;
since sin came into the world all we have is alms, it is of
the charity of the Great Almoner that we receive what we
call our possessions."</p>

<p>The knights took courage, and became for the time
beggars, and, asking food "for the love of God," received
all they wanted!</p>

<p>After this halt they reached Assisi in another stage.
The old Bishop Guido came to see his "son" as soon as
he arrived. The moment he looked at him he knew that
his days were numbered, and he entreated him to let
himself be moved to his house, where he could have more
comfort. This was done, but nothing could really ease
Francis' sufferings. The swelling that had begun at
Cortona disappeared, and he rapidly became terribly thin.
He could not make the slightest effort without terrible
suffering, and his eyes were so bad that he could barely
distinguish light from darkness&mdash;feeling alone remained,
and we are told that every part of his body was the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of sharp pains! The doctors declared they could not tell
what kept him alive!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Farewell to Assisi.</i></div>

<p>"My father," said one who was tending him once, "Do
you not think you would suffer less under the hands of an
executioner?"</p>

<p>"My brother," answered Francis, "my dearest and
sweetest wish has always been, and still is, to do what
God demands of me; with all my soul I desire to conform
myself in all things to His pleasure and will, but martyrdom
would be less difficult to bear than three days of this
illness. I mean speaking of the suffering it brings, not of
the recompense it merits."</p>

<p>As the suffering days lengthened into months, Francis
seemed to rise above himself. He lay there smiling and
calm, and every hour his soul became more strong and
vigorous. Not that he was by any means free from
temptation. We read that "his soul bore the most violent
assaults without flinching."</p>

<p>In October he was taken back to Portiuncula. His one
desire now was to die near the spot where God had first
revealed Himself to him. He was placed on a litter, and
slowly the bearers descended the mountain.</p>

<p>"Turn me towards the town," he said when they
reached the valley, and sitting up with a painful effort, he
gazed for the last time in the direction of Assisi.</p>

<p>"Be blessed of the Lord," he said solemnly, "O town
faithful to God. Many souls shall be saved in you and
by you."</p>

<p>His first duty when he arrived at home was to make
what he called his will! This is a recapitulation of the
fundamental principles of his life, and a short account of
the first early days of the brotherhood. He charges all to
be true to the one rule of the Order.</p>

<p>"I absolutely forbid," he writes at the close, "all my
brethren, whether clerks or laymen, to put glosses on the
Rule, or on this writing, saying, 'thus it ought to be
understood,' but as the Lord has given me grace to
dictate purely and simply, understand them simply and
without gloss, and put them in practice unto the end."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Light at Eventide.</i></div>

<p>Wise Francis, his knowledge of human nature was only
equalled to his charity and long-suffering!</p>

<p>After this piece of work was accomplished he quietly
resigned himself to die, and holding up his hands to
Heaven, cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Oh Christ, I have nothing to keep me back! I
shall go freely to Thee."</p>

<p>The end came rapidly. Each day found him weaker
than the preceding one, and it was with difficulty that he
was able to speak to those around him. Fifty of the
brethren, who were then at the Portiuncula, knelt round
his bed.</p>

<p>"My father," said one of them, bending over him,
"your sons will have no father. In you we lose the light
of life. And now forgive those present and those absent
for all the sins they have committed. Bless them once
more."</p>

<p>"My son," said Francis, "God is calling me! I forgive
my brethren, those present and those absent, all
their sins and faults. I absolve them as much as I can.
Tell them so, and bless them in my name."</p>

<p>He then asked them to read him the history of the
Passion in St. John's Gospel, and then a part of the one
hundred and forty-second Psalm. As they were reading the
seventh verse:</p>

<p>"Bring my soul out of prison that I may praise Thy
name," he closed his eyes and slept peacefully in Jesus.</p>

<p>His glorious death took place just a few days before he
entered his forty-sixth year, twenty years since he received
his call to repair the Church, and eighteen since he founded
the Order of Friars Minor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
